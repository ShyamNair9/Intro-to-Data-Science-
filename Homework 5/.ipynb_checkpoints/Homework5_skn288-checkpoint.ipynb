    "1\\. From your reading you know that the naive Bayes classifier works by calculating the conditional probabilities of each feature, $e_i$, occuring with each class $c$ and treating them independently. This results in the probability of a certain class occuring given a set of features, or a piece of evidence, $E$, as\n",

    "$$P(c \\mid E) = \\frac{p(e_1 \\mid c) \\cdot p(e_2 \\mid c) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot p(e_k \\mid c) \\cdot p(c)}{p(E)}.$$\n",

    "The conditional probability of each piece of evidence occuring with a given class is given by\n",

    "In the above equation $\\text{count}(e_i, c)$ is the number of documents in a given class that contain feature $e_i$ and $\\text{count}(c)$ is the number of documents that belong to class $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common variation of the above is to use Laplace (sometimes called +1) smoothing. Recall the use of Laplace smoothing introduced toward the end of Chapter 3 in the section Probability Estimation. This is done in sklearn by setting `alpha=1` in the `BernoulliNB()` function (this is also the default behavior). The result of Laplace smoothing will slightly change the conditional probabilities,\n",

    "Naive Bayes works with the assumption that the attributes are mutually independent. Having this assumption may cause the classifier to be very biased. Having a high bias means that the model does not have high accuracy which is because of underfitting and high variance means that the model gives different results for small changes which is because of overfitting. The Naive Bayes classifier has high bias but low variance becuase it is a simple model using few parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assuming that the attributes are mutually independent of each other may not be true in every case. Assume a case where for some value of 'i', P(ei|c) is zero.  Since we are using multiplication, this would make the entire probability value for class 'c', P(c||E) to be zero. This is highly undesirable and we will get inaccurate results. For example, while filtering spams, let's say that the word 'graduate' appears just once in the spam mails and never appears in any of the ham mails. The probability P(grading| spam) will be some small value whereas it would be zero for P(grading| ham). Now, since we use muliplication to calculate probabilities, if any email consists the word 'grading' in it, it would never be classifies as 'ham' which is ridiculous. Thus, we use the techinique of smoothing. Using Laplace's smoothing ensures that we wont get the probability as zero (for any of the words in this case). This would definitely give us a more accurate estimation. Thus, introducing Laplace's smoothing helps to decrease the high bias of the Naive Bayes classifier without increasing the variance too much."

    "As seen from the above graph, Logistic Regression (using tfidf) model performs better than the Naive Bayes model. This happens because of the mutual independence assumption in the Naive Bayes model. As a result, Naive Bayes will give equal weight to even those features which are correlated to each other. Logistic Regression on the other hand can compensate them by giving them lower weights. Now, since we get a better plot for Logistic Regression model, it is evident that there are correlated features in our dataset. Also, the dataset is fairly large. If it was very small, then Logreg model may have overfitted it resulting in lower performance. When it comes to count vectorizer vs tfidf vectorizer, the latter performs better since the former only counts the word frequencies whereas the latter considers the word frequencies as well as how many times that word is used in the document, i.e., tfidf vectorizer gives less importance to words which are repeated several times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Naive Bayes models perform identically. This is because we are using binary vectorizers and all the non-zero counts are converted to 1. This makes both the models essentially work the same as Bernoulli Naive Bayes model giving the same output."

      "8 'Midnight Cowboy is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America. Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released. But be warned its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable well-developed and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the 80s. Still this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film. Its a time when well-made innovative and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this was over by the time Star Wars was released. The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects Midnight Cowboy has aged quite well. Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released. The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece. The characters backgrounds are never fully explained but the performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus being a fan of vintage exploitation films I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street. Midnight Cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made.

On an inner layer we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand. At first glance it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy. If so then Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered. In particular Ms. Keatons performance is flighty and over the top well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of stridence with her hi-pitched voice and whining style. All of this could be forgiven if it werent for the last 20 minutes of this movie that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981. ***Careful spoilers ahead*** It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius by the way is a male name and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with.) When they all admit that they dont live up to the churchs teachings the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny all-too-cliché sepia-tone flashbacks. When one of them admits to having two abortions the nun becomes even more abusive until the pupil pulls out a gun. After wrestling it away from her the nun kills the pupil presumably in self-defense. She then goes on a screaming rampage killing a gay former student because of his sins. The last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a Christ-like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her. Can you say `heavy handed? I knew you could! I know there have been abusive nuns in the past and I know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie. I have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously no pun intended. This explanation is hard to swallow though simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply anti-Catholic tripe which in the name of fairness and equality is mean spirited and hateful. This is a film I would recommend for a catholic namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it were `Rabbi Ray explains it all or `Imam Muhammad explains it all there would be rioting in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription. But sadly because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view. I certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic so it wasnt just ignorance that brought them to make this film. I give it 1.5 stars out of 5 not because of its offensive nature but because it was poorly written poorly directed and just a bad movie in general. Dont even waste your time.'\n",

Bang bang bang. Purvis emerges alone from the house carrying the female hostage the miscreant dead. All in long shot.

Multiple violations of the civic code. Plenty of shoot outs with Tommy guns and pistols. Blood all over. As history it stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero partly I would guess because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though. The picture was written and directed by John Milius. Hes the guy who had it written into his contract that should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions he should be the designated shooter. Milius is the guy a compleat gun freak who had Teddy Roosevelts Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war shouting quotations from Henry V -- Saint Crispins Day and all that.

      "33 'The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle. At first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity-themed morality comedies of Cecil B. De Mille but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture. Even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense. As well as being a student of the German Expressionist style the rhythmic editing style of Sergei Eisenstein had had its impact upon Hitchcock. But here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery. This is apparent from the opening shots where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo. And like Eisenstein the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a split-second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring. There is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the US in that The Ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards. As much as possible is conveyed by imagery and Hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip-read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters speech. And its not done by contrived symbolism or overacting its all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with point-of-view shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances. There are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices (particularly double exposures) many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in The Lodger. Lets make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors. First up the stunningly handsome and very talented Carl Brisson in the lead role. In spite of his talent I was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist! But that just goes to show how much I know as it turns out Brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting. Playing his rival is the competent Ian Hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s. The most demanding role in The Ring has to be that given to Lillian Hall-Davis torn between two lovers. She pulls it off very well however with an emotive understated performance and its a shame her career never lasted in the sound era. And last but not least the great Gordon Harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role. The Rings climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent-era Hitchcock. Martin Scorcese may have had his eye on The Ring when he directed the fight scenes in Raging Bull as his watchword for these scenes was Stay inside the ring. The fight in The Ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action intensifies Hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with close-ups and point-of-view shots. Hitchcocks aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the characters fear or paranoia. The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger. Its a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features.'\n",

Set in Los Angeles the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American angst. Stereotyped smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday humdrum lives. The plot is disjointed and desultory. Numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going like: a drive-by shooting an abandoned baby left in the weeds a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer a guy flying through the night sky over the city a kid at summer camp. And through all these events the one constant is the generous helping of sociological insights imparted through the dialogue as characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character tells another: When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon) you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me I could tell me and my worries; its real humorous to that Grand Canyon. And another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: Theres a gulf in this country an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who dont have ... its like this big hole has opened up in the ground as big as the ... Grand Canyon and whats come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage and the rage creates violence .... Aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue aside from the shallow smarmy characters aside from the dumb plot the storys pace is agonizingly slow. Acting is uninspired and perfunctory. The films tone is smug and self-satisfied in the scripts contempt for viewers. This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus looking down from on high. They think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly unknowing movie goers eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.'\n",

Everyday items such as crates boxes metal containers etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects dart by Burtynskys camera. He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them that is. Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynskys lens (but didnt we already know that from Wall-E?). He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places) with their uniform clothing and robotic movements become part of the industrial landscape. Manufactured Landscapes a documentary about Burtynskys work has much of the feel of a Koyaanisqatsi about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns. Indeed director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China a dockyard in Bangladesh and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China. With their fluid camera-work the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynskys images. In fact the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the themes of his work which quite frankly come out sounding confused contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best. But it is as a purely aesthetic experience highlighting image and form that Manufactured Landscapes resonates most. In the case of Burtynsky perhaps a picture really IS worth a thousand words.'\n",

      "96 'Ice Age is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the companys first. We are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge AND PLEASE NOTE: the sound of Scrats screams is the sound of Toms screams from the Tom and Jerry cartoons) a woolly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano of Everybody Loves Raymond) a sloth named Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo of Titan A. E.) and a saber toothed tiger named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary of Pixars A Bugs Life). The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that he caused an avalanche. We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age (except for Manny who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him). Sid comes out of his cave yawning and saw that his family abandoned him. He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Unfortunately he gets pursued by Sylvia (voiced by Kirsten Johnston of 3rd Rock from the Sun) a female orange sloth who wants Sid to go migrating with her. Sid eventually teams up with Manny and they became friends. Meanwhile nearby a human tribe Soto (voiced by Goran Visnjic) an evil saber toothed tiger wants revenge against the tribes leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son Roshan away from him. In the morning he Diego and Sotos henchmen Lenny (voiced by Alan Tudyk) Oscar (voiced by Diedrich Bader) and Zeke (voiced by Jack Black) attacked the tribe but the leaders wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after. Eventually Diego joins them and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe who are also looking for him as well. Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out okay? Besides Manny Sid Diego Scrat Sylvia and Roshan the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshans tribe are using and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer (voiced by Jane Krakowski) and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel (voiced by Lorri Bagley) to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit. Incidentally the two rhinos Carl (voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDIs Madagascar) and Frank (voiced by Stephen Root of Pixars Finding Nemo) who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff are simple minor characters. Same went for the dodos who are using melons as their food supply. The gags in this movie are very funny. For instance Manny talks through his trunk saying IM NOT GOING! When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit Sid asks Jennifer What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens? Jennifer then responds to him What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT!? Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist. Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth then she asks Sid if hes holding his breath tells Diego to eat him and promptly walks off. Since Ice Age is not only a success but it has 2 sequels: the first one was Ice Age: The Meltdown which was released in 2006 and the other was Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs which is going to be releasing next year. I can hardly die waiting to see what Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs will be like.'\n",

      "99 'This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. Television moved out of my life in 1981 so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that Im immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers.  (Possible spoiler warning)  The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic caveman meets fluffball yarn where a charming red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises that the scripts wit is based on must have already felt stale around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writing as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance.  I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment but in this particular case Im all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it.  In one sense however this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job. Both features show to what amazing extent Willis acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1 In Country). Impressive!  Rating (and I _am_ a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10'\n",

This is a PRIVATE plot built as a PRIVATE enterprise. This is a self-destructive and a self organized plot. As a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private self organized self-destructive with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart director with some money. All can be done just by delegation. The director must be just trigger. If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered. All the actors performances are well done  with some special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.'\n",

I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how its not about dieting its about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this. Beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth yells the words Its not about you. to her mother. Those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. I think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.'\n",

      ". just trashy cheesy campy and enormously fun! Its almost unbelievable that Ruggero Deodato director of Cannibal Holocaust of all people was the man responsible for this comical cash-in on the contemporary popular Sword & Sandal fantasy flicks particularly Schwarzeneggers Conan movies. The film opens with a terrific once-upon-a-time type of off-screen narrator introducing us to the Ragneks. Their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers. In other words the Ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks! Their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy Kadar kidnaps the Ragneks beautiful queen Canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby. Meanwhile and as some sort of amusing waste of time the two orphan twin-brothers Gore and Kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and theyre unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death. Instead of that however they escape and develop a plan to free their queen. Actually the plot isnt half as bad as I initially feared but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers on screen chemistry the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy-monsters like a dragon with adorably cute eyes some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp. The soundtrack and make-up effects are great and our almighty director Deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace. The Barbarian Brothers acting capacities are much better than I anticipated apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds. The supportive cast is splendid as well. Eva La Rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl Cara Virginia Bryant is indeed bewitching like Richard Lynch states on several occasions and the lovely Sheeba Alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut-shaped hair style (I kid you not!). Last but not least The Barbarians stars everybodys favorite Eyes in the Hills creep Michael Berryman as the appropriately named Dirtmaster. I know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the Village People but The Barbarians really is a must-see Italian exploitation highlight.'\n",

This installment of the Star Trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since TOS to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of Going Where No Man Has Gone Before. Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer the first Captain of the first Star Ship Enterprise. He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer TPol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.'\n",
      "132 'One of John Fords best films The Informer doesnt feature any grand scenery of the American West. Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglens face. The former prizefighter who once faced Joe Louis in the ring delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. The plot is gracefully simple: In 1922 Dublin a starving and humiliated man whos been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant. For £20 he betrays a friend to the Tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions.  It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the films most impressive achievement. In most movies a burly lout of Gypos type would be cast as the heavy hed have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown. In The Informer Gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience. Because Liam OFlahertys novel had previously been filmed in 1929 RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglens Oscar The Informer also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score.'\n",

John Dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery blackmailing in the early 90s. Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction. But nowadays Mr Dahl has resorted to directing television shows.Its a shame since the man had talent. ***SPOILERS** This is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter Cage) that comes in to the town of Wyoming for a job. However he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit-man from Texas by bar owner J.T Walsh. He is given the task to kill his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it. On the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road who he then takes back to the local hospital. At that point Cage coincidently meets Walsh again who also appears to be the local sheriff. After that Cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit-man that happens to be Dennis Hopper. John Dahl has co-written and directed this movie. Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen. The direction is of good standard however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling. There were too many close up frames. However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience. The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght. Cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained. His facial expressions were on the mark. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees. Hopper played his part well. But I feel he was miscast for this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man. The role was not written keeping his personality in mind. While viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like The Hot Spot and A Perfect Murder. Due to the fact that some sub plots are similar. Overall if you are a fan of noir movies then this one is for you. Worth recommending. 7/10'\n",

I was totally blown away by the movie and especially TCs performance I thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what I was expecting. I had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it I am so pleased that I was coerced into seeing it. The strange thing is I cannot say why all I can say is that I found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day. As to what I felt about the film all I can say about is ITS NOT THE STORYLINE (fantasy psychodrama whatever) its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events like getting into a car can change everything...... As to what the critics wrote yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for Alejandro Amenábar  but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. I cannot even consider writing a couple of trite glib sentences to describe the film just go and see it!!!! Yes I know this isnt a balanced thoughtful review but so what .Its not that kind of film.'\n",
      "168 'I just dont see how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad. It just boggles the mind doesnt it? Well lets make no mistake about it. Munchie Strikes Back is indeed a bad film. Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The moms problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20000. Ouch. She cant come up with the money because she just got fired. OK...JUST is the key word in that sentence. What the...? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? Maybe it wouldve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think? Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isnt a limit on the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was borrowing it from. The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Sadly those dumb parents watching the game dont think its at all strange. Hmm. Anyway Id like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. Youll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her. Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. Munchie Strikes Backs credits promised another film to follow entitled I believe Munchie Hangs Ten. To date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. Heh. 1/10'\n",
      "169 'I suppose that any novel thats as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find much favor with Depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence.  In fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it not that too much of it was kept for the film. We first meet Ahab Creely (hes got a last name and a brother) as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett who is Father Mapples daughter. That brother Derek played by Lloyd Hughes also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab in an over the top performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in. We see Ahab lose his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome. Of course this was all before the Code. Still Im sure 1930 audiences shuddered. After that the story of Ahabs hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in Joan Bennetts eyes. That is not exactly Melvilles motivation in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. One of the things Melville did was invest the crew of Ahabs ship the Pequod with personalities. Other than Queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. Id see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.'\n",

      "172 'The pre-release version of 1933s Baby Face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her fathers speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except Lilys childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lilys hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors. Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930s owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women. The plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher. Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles and she is in top form here. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her African-American confidante Chico receives Lilys affection trust and loyalty. In more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris who plays Chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However despite Stanwycks tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including Douglass Dumbrille Donald Cook and a young John Wayne. The preferred version of Baby Face is the 76-minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche whose views on women were controversial. However despite Alphonse Ethiers lectures and advice not to be defeated by life Lilys grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However the philosophy is but a distraction. Short fast paced and entertaining Baby Face is as contemporary in its morality as Wall Street. Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good.'\n",

She takes a (really fake looking) mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it. Well pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. And shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the womans family. This is actually REALLY BORING overall and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it. But if you keep at it you may just make it to the end.  Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the mummys spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to ascertain what the spirits motivation is but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low-budget (and 70s hairstyles!) this will have a certain comforting appeal. The way I have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled boring way the film lays the story out. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well...somehow this one achieves that. Maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way. I dont know. What I do know is that I enjoyed it quite a bit despite its dullness. Fans of Spider Baby will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one (including an instrumental version of the theme song). Featuring one frightening and fairly well-done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper. Other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky; but this one scene is actually pretty scary. See this! Its weird and its worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.'\n",

It is amateurish self-indulgent criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish. The whore mangler of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers. There is a little nudity and some erections but no single element could possibly save this from the hangmans noose. The lighting is appalling the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted and the direction is clueless. I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those featured. He spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this I see nothing of any import whatsoever. There is no style either and the horrible video effects (like solarization) only enhance the amateurishness. Not even so bad its fun. Avoid.'\n",

One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back...even if that means killing Tarzan. This is a rarity--a sequel thats better than the original. Tarzan the Ape Man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged. This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult. There is tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares) but this was 1934. Theres also plenty of blood gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints have Jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude! Theres also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing and (its implied) they sleep together and have sex--without being married. This wouldnt bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme. That aside the movie is well-directed very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Janes outfit is pretty revealing too. I still think Maureen OSullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everybody else is OK. This is easily the best Weismuller--OHara Tarzan out there.

The Australian coast scenery is simply splendid to see. What a place to visit to say the least and one day it may become my hideaway.

In fact the film is so far from that that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--its so...so...unreal. And it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This isnt necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing. What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit I was going to puke. The bottom line is that like American musicals not every French musical is gold. This film is not another Les parapluies de Cherbourg (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or Huit Femmes (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou I cant see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity.'\n",

We know that her movies have been semi-autobiographical of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty. Mukhsin is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date (though I must add as a personal bias that Sepet still has a special place in my heart). Our favourite family is back - Pak Atan Mak Inom Orked and Kak Yam though this time we go back to when Orked is age 10. The characters are all younger from the movies weve journeyed with them from Rabun to Gubra and here Sharifah Amanis sisters Sharifah Aryana and Sharifah Aleya take on the roles of Orked and Mak Inom respectively which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen nevermind that their not playing sibling roles. The only constant it seems is Kak Yam played by Adibah Noor and even Pak Atan has hair on his head! Through Mukshin the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that Yasmin has introduced us to. We come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more set in the days when theyre still living in their kampung (revisited back in Rabun) where Orked attends a Chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches (and you wonder about that burst of energy in Gubra well she had it in her since young!). The perennial tomboy and doted child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless masak-masak with the girls and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches. The arrival of a boy called Mukhsin (Mohd Syafie Naswip) to the village provides a cool peer for Orked to hang out and do stuff with - cycling through the villages climbing trees flying kites. And as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotions. Mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood. In short those scenes screamed fun! We observe the life in a typical kampung where some neighbours are very nice while others the nosy parkers and rumour mongers spreading ill gossip stemming from envy. There are 2 additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate neighbour and the other from Mukhsins own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to Orkeds own. As always Yasmins movies are filled with excellent music and for Mukhsin it has something special the song Hujan as penned by her father as well as Ne Me Quitte Pas aptly used in the movie Given that the Yasmins movies to date have been centred around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and pieced together makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance love and forgiveness. Fans will definitely see the many links in Mukhsin back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events like that pudgy boy who steals glances at Orked. And speaking of whys parts of Mukhsin too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of Yasmins style or deliberately left as such. I thought that as a story about childhood recollected from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure. And subtly I felt that Mukhsin exhibited this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two. Another highly recommended movie and a rare one that I feel is suitable for all ages - bring along your kid brother or sister!'\n",

I felt the films biggest problem was its lack of a main plot. Instead it was composed of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact any one sub-plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film. (The time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub-plots and characters.) Simply put The Hungry Bachelors Clubs plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired.'\n",

The only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den giving insight into the animals loves and lives... Lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals. Sounds good huh? Well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core... *** Spoilers Below - Or they it may be a Warning!*** Almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind. But seems to get along well enough and theres a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him... And then he dies... Next we have one of the siblings adventures. And then he dies... One of the sisters gets her screen-time... and then she dies...And so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature in traps just up and vanish and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred. Though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen. (Least not in the version we saw.) Unlike say Tarka the Otter the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It is a nature film after all. But not nearly the whole family. Do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids. Watch it with some foreknowledge that things are *not* going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are. You may enjoy it.

I was 11 when I originally saw this on video and at such youth I wasnt able to notice the shoddy cartoon-quality or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are Not the same or as good to see. Just about everything is so 2D here! Belle is Ill agree not even beautiful but just a plain-looking woman with tinted skin she wears the same bright blue dress all the way through with not one glamorous dress on Wardrobe is to say the Least annoying - my ears may bleed if I had to listen to her everyday! Lumiere in both the original and the Christmas edition was suave and elegant but here he is a womanizing unfunny twit! Cogsworth despite being the no-nonsense housekeeper he is famous for is a complete sh-t and the most insufferable character Id say! He always seems to find shutting that unbearably grating pie-hole of his very difficult in this one and whose clock face should really have been used for turning back in time to the unforgettable two film in this series! Poor poor Mrs Potts was not brought to life by Angela Lansbury (one of my favourite classic actresses) but by Anne Rogers who captured none of Mrs Potts character no offence to her! Not if she did her best! When the beast roars it sounds so horrifically fake with clearly no additional roars snarls or growls by a microphone. I am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it wouldnt be as good but Im sure that more of a contribution wouldnt have hurt the Disney artists who indeed have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years. Its alright I guess and I do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me. Its quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies!

For example there is a shoot out at Rob Lowes characters house- two cars are stolen and yet the cops dont show up there till much later in the movie. Murder for hire never looked so implausible. Whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets. Many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this.

Yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie (with CG animated cells and peptides to boot). However the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feel-good hogwash in between plot segments. Sure it stars off innocently enough. There is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. It states for example that electrons exist as both particle and wave and that an atom is mostly empty space. However the movie takes a giant (and unscientific) leap saying that sub-atomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well. The talking heads take it even further. According to them the following are true: -When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. -With positive thought you can walk on water. -Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water. And hey thats only in the first 40 minutes! Watching the movie was torture. This film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult. After doing my homework I realized that it basically is just that. On the other hand this could be seen as a campy comedy (albeit one thats not funny).

      "228 'I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew but I rented it basically because of the stars. I certainly was not sorry. In fact as you see I rated it five stars. This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting. Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents jewelry store. The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons. Younger brother Hank is basically a screw-up. He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure cowardly and very much under the influence of his big brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank nailed to a T and gives what is probably his best performance thus far. He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task. Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents store and he gets weak-willed Hank to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who on the surface is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath. He is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or it might be said that he through his superior acting skills made Andy the perfect part. Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself. He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and Andy. As we get to know Charles and Andy the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable. On a personal note I cannot believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own father and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant critical father a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home. Fortunately my brother and I never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff. This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead but he hasnt lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered. The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead are harsh and unattractive and this is definitely not a feel-good movie. However it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which I thoroughly recommend.'\n",

      "233 'So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to? Mmm",
      " to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths. Anyhow by the end of While She Was Out I was left feeling rather indifferent. Not the worse (despite being engulfed by negatives) but theres easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park. The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material (taken from a short story) along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thought-out (which isnt so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off) so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons (led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon) terrorizing Basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand (dont ask me why?) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didnt elicit tension or emotion",
      " but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. Basingers performance is stout-like but doesnt craft much empathy. Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot-headed husband. Strangely I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen",

      " her choices were quite disappointing. Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead. Susan Montfords soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along. I liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score (which is the most effective thing throughout the feature) and polished photography. No great shakes. Doesnt ask much of your time but I wouldnt care to see it again. However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen.'\n",

It was touted as the best film in Montreals most recent film festival which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry. Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell. Its from Austria and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. Theres the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child the über-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists... The list goes on. Forever. Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatre. Yes the characters interact but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. I couldnt say if they were any good as actors as according to the subtitles they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of You are so lame! They certainly didnt have to learn many as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene. This is no Gummo or any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your never walk out during a movie policy (which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing its not unless youre one of few who doesnt find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples to boot- revolting). This movie was offensive to me. Not the flabby nudity not the cringe-inducing soundtrack not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find. Most of all I was offended that somehow the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease.

But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldnt have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasnt. No split involved in his award. The movie and the story by Liam OFlaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in. Hes down to his last pence and if he cant get back in wants enough for passage to America. Theres a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip. The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and theyre pretty certain it was McLaglen. He hasnt the wit to really cover his own tracks. He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a hanger-on played by J.M. Kerrigan. The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning. Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller. Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to. John Ford knew this world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean OFiernan. Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril. The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court Meek aint in a position to say no. The Kings justice and writ does not run here. It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the British are indeed losing their grip on the population. Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect. Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing. The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time.'\n",

Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen Gary Cooper W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming).

The Sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me not delivering the consistent action a couple of critics promised on the back. To me it seemed like everyone was Halfassing it and only there to make some quick cash because this felt very much like a made for TV film. The Sentinel is a rehash of several better films like In The Line Of Fire this does not have any originality in it and watching Michael Douglas run around felt kinda silly in my opinion. The Main problem besides its unoriginality had to be the poor pace. I often got distracted while trying to view this movie while looking how much run time was left more then once. Not only the miscasting with Eva Longoria who couldnt convince worth a lick. Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a dependable actor here is obviously going through the motions. He does not convince as a man on a run or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also off. Im a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland but here he is only OK nothing more then that. He tries to come across as a gruff but managed to be more bland then anything else and to be honest he didnt seem that interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role and was pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady. She looks bored to tears and her role is a throw away more then anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part in the end but not enough to matter for me. Bottom line. The Sentinel is yet another political thriller that bored me to tears. Its too old too tired and most importantly the lack of effort sucked. Not recommended. 4/10'\n",

Anyway onto the actual review. WHAT I LIKED: There was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell one of the few Ive seen in animated films. Character development existed! Its easy to classify characters in this movie (i.e.: Charlie is the selfish mutt Itchy is cynical but believes Charlie Carface is obviously the relentless villain etc.). I also loved King Gators song. Ive always loved loud annoying flamboyant guys. This song may have been random but it was so fun. Finally the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could tell Charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: The actual portrayal of heaven: The way Charlie reacted to it no surprises whatsoever made it actually seem very boring. He denied a place in heaven and STILL got to return to it in the end. I remember a few lines of certain songs such as ... you cant keep a good dog down ... lets make music forever and ... welcome to being dead but I cant remember the majority of any of them. The songs werent that catchy to be honest. Whippet Angel: Shes annoying and that NECK! AUGH! WHAT PARENTS MAY NOT LIKE: A few very scary (depending on the viewer) images of Hell are shown during the movie. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implied but not actually DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element in the movie. The good guy dies. OVERALL: I LOVE this movie even if it is a bit forgettable at times. The scarier childrens animations are always my favorite ones. This was created back in a time when producers and writers werent afraid to give kids a little scare now and then. Nowadays this probably would have been rated PG. Kids under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed kids) should not watch this. Other than that I give it 9/10. :) Happy Viewing!'\n",

Id rather see Milan Kunderas novel turned on fire than into this something which the director probably calls adaptation. All the beautiful philosophy that asks is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being? is put aside and instead all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife his mistress and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad movies. Dont waste your time and money. Read the book instead its really worth it.'\n",

On the other hand Im not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be BSG fans and not like the pilot. What the frack did they expect?!! The background is setting 50 years before BSG we are there o assist at the birth of the Cylons see the life of the Adama family (has we already knew some of it from BSG) get a deeper explanation of the Caprican population and its perception of the other colonies and potentially the origins of the Gods belief of the human and the unique God belief of the Cylons.  I do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series I make the difference between the two although I know that Caprica will reinforce BSG. This is 1h30 of promising start I believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as BSG.

After a dazzling opening shot flick quickly settles into B-movie formula. It certainly looks good but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a bit stiff.

The dated aspect aside Jigsaw suffers from many problems including overwrought acting silly and stilted dialogue LSD flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is on paper a great vehicle to do just that and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it was a better movie we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night TV fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebodys insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out.

So eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself. One of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie. In this case the term dark psychological thriller. Read: hack writer/director who thinks hes an auteur who replaces plot story and action with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul. His great insight? Festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults. Wow I bet Freud would be really impressed! Too many would be film makers like Kallio who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades fail to dig their own fresh grave. Instead they fall into the pre-dug graves of the many other directors that came before them. They are content with rehashing old and tired horror clichés that they borrowed from a dozen or more films. The result is an unoriginal uninspired unbelievable waste of film stock.'\n",

The characters are truly young Mary is a strong match for Byron Claire is juvenile and a tad annoying Polidori is a convincing beaten-down sycophant... all are beautiful curious and decadent... not the frightening wrecks they are in Gothic. Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film and I loved it for different reasons but this works like a Merchant and Ivory film and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like.

I find mafia movies to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood and in this case the Italian cinema treat these guys as heroes. I saw the film and in a few days I wont remember much about it. Lots of shooting innocent bystanders dying betrayal and that sick loyalty.

Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons and while this isnt the tamest of the bunch; there isnt a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that its on the shopping list. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself The Devil (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really arent many scenes of interest. Its a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z Venus in Furs Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say Ive seen everything on the DPPs list (just two more to go!) and Im guessing thats why most other people who have seen it saw it. But if youre not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.'\n",

For example- in one episode Johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick. Amazingly by the end of the show Johnny had healed entirely. Along with that the stories on this were no where near as strong as The Big Valley. This is a show that I would not want DVDs of & frankly hope they are never released.

However Id be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur. And the chemistry between Arthur and co-star William Powell is real and its fun romantic and involving. The story and screenplay by Anthonyu Vieller and John Wynes production company partner James Edward Grant (The Angel & The Bad Man) is close to being up there with a Thin Man effort but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.

      "379 'Since starting to read the book this movie is based on Im having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of Atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book Ive ever seen it would probably not have mattered. Im trying to figure out what the cause is and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Mintons book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it. Its not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie which is why since I started reading the novel Im feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said its not so much that some novels dont deserve to be a movie; its more like some books just cant make the transition. Ms. Mintons novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be I feel not filmable. I think that Ms. Mintons work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value. I cannot yet report that Evening the film does not represent Evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since Im only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess Im writing this because I feel that if youre going to adapt a novel adapt it but dont make it something else that its not. Im not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone elses work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway and we would not have Evening in its distressed form if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But its too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone because Evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own. Thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are.'\n",

An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as humor or even entertainment in Rabbit Test. So as a small contribution to this future effort Id like to suggest this word:  Hubiriffic (adj.) A combination of hubristic and terrific; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film Rabbit Test. Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. Trying to put together an Airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags (Note to Joan: German doctors havent been funny since Vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the Catskills - thats is bad enough. But compounding this cinematic crime is Rivers directorial style which can best be described as ugly and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags. Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the films hapless protagonist Lionel. Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face. I can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test. Cabbages mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates.

This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals. CitizenX may also argue against(!) the death penalty far better than Kevin Spaceys The Life of David Gayle(2002). Humans are Machiavellian mammals under which lie limbic brains (lizard-logic). Why did two kids who knew better stone to death a toddler they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women yell `li-lilililililii at acts of OBSCENE terrorism? -My own term for this is `limbic domination the lizard-logic urge to dominate an `enemy. If you have the words `enemy/`vengeance in your vocabulary youre easily capable of `limbic domination. In WWII-devastated 1980s Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don river near the Black Sea) nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilos urge for `limbic domination from overpowering his layers of civilization. Chikatilo(Jeffrey DeMunn)s easy victims were paupers usually children who rode the interurban train for fun since they couldnt afford anything else. CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such `lambs. Rostovs serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go. The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere. Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world in the west vote-grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter-agency rivalries stymieing a more coordinated response to crime. In the Soviet Union of CitizenX however Viktor Burakov(Stephen Rea)s Killer Department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy. Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority--to the point of complete obscurity. In real life too Chikatilo had a lifetimes experience blending in and evading capture. His pursuer on the other hand sticks out as a strange bird given to unheralded naive outbursts. Perhaps by design Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief Burakov. Reas Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humourless and sullen at odds with everyone. So its Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture. Sutherlands Col.Fetisov Burakovs boss and at first his only supporter is an overly restrained patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His reawakening as a logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the films cornerstone idealism. Joss Ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk overseeing the investigation. Naturally he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect a Communist in 1984 a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo. Soon he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik Detective Gorbunov(John Wood) insisting that the investigation now focus on `known homosexuals. The funniest scene of this sad sad film comes during Bondarchuks & Gorbunovs institutionalized harassment: one stupid cop earnestly reports `As I suspected comrade its fornication. Ive made some drawings--cue howling laughter. 5yrs after the bodies began piling up in 1987 the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky(Max Von Sydow) who termed the UNSUB `CitizenX. He later also observed to Fetisov & Burakov that `...together you make a wonderful person. We concur. The drawn-out pace spread over a decade perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost--`openness--that wasnt. The contrast with Perestroika--`restructuring--couldntve been greater for the case. Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations police plans were about to bear fruit. In 1990 Col.Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. Staff communications publicity--suddenly all were available. In just one night of telephoning around Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the FBIs Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico where Fetisov discovered staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators. Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief now `Colonel Burakov of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movies powerhouse watershed scene. Fetisovs is the most tender apology Ive ever seen on film: `Privately I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance he almost whispers. A HBO production CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber. Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest) but Randy Edelmans soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. Chikatilos actual murders are depicted as bleak aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world. This makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place--but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us `we all cherish the futures of our children. CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply. Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. So do some soldiers. Such `limbic dominators make poor humans. WARNING-SPOILER:----------------------------------------------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the worlds most prolific known serial killer. Convicted he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet Union death sentences: one shot in the back of the head. Foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death. Conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ The best outcome is always the prevention of killings not their prosecution. Executions merely guarantee societys failure to learn from the complex reality of victims deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW/WHY they died. Nor do killers learn regret if theyre dead. Vengeance doesnt unkill victims. Baying for the killers blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once its too late. Vengeance on behalf of the grieving isnt justice for the deceased--its appeasement of the living.(10/10)'\n",
      "402 'Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest thats all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting. The opening scene in space is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before youve had time to work out whether its you whos gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to life. And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius. The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that Ive only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.

The film is obviously leaning towards to P.O.V. of the common deaf perception their is no middle ground. Also the film didnt make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic. I.E. Deaf People who were born hearing and later went deaf. Is it right or wrong in that instance? The film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the Deaf w/ a capital D.

      "414 'This is easily the most disappointing least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre which by the way are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home. Rather than being exploitation or demeaning these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era. Well not Bucktown. In this story Duke returns to Bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother. He quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses. Duke resists and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police. Unfortunately he does so by calling in a posse of his friends (these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with Duke on jobs in the past) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood. And literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it. Ignorance is not a justification for murder and it would have been much more entertaining to see the Cracker Police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street. While revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre it is a far cry from seeing Pam Grier track down the thugs who offed her family cuss them out give them a jujitsu ass-kickin and set their fro on fire. That has art (and a reason for existing) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back. Of course in this bizarre tale she is playing a woman completely under The Mans thumb afraid of the Crackers who run her town and oppress her people. Indeed her advice to Duke is Run man they gonna kill you! Following the sickening and gratuitous violence we are expected to believe that the towns mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of Duke and his friends congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor as opposed to say calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody. Dukes posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree. They immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their Cracker Police predecessors (to quote the mayor They are ten times worse than what we had before!). Now Duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of Bucktown from corrupt protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets. Unfortunately Duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force. I wouldnt have cared one way or the other if he had rescued Bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point. I suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way Duke has to outsmart the new Police Goons but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence Duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the Cracker Police. Duke is a pig. Finally when everyone in town but Duke Aretha and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin in the street our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they dont. Duke is merely a murderous thug and Aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice. If you are interested in this genre of film by all means I highly recommend them see Coffy Foxy Brown Truck Turner Blacula Sheba Baby",

      "415 'Contains *spoilers* - also my quotes may not be exact. Everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true. But to me I see this movie as much more than that. I love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it wont stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate: Thats ingenious - can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to petrol? The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasnt worked after all - standing there almost naked. Yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didnt work. Hes never really intimidated by people. Remember But Sidney we want to stop it too. Barely a moments hesitation before hes off trying to get away again. Does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal mustve caused? No. Also notable is Dapnes role. She is sick and tired of money and power. She thinks shes finally found love outside of her fathers company. At first she doesnt really care about Sidney anymore than anyone else. But that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention. Shes finally found something she thinks is worth living for. The funny thing is that its not even romance. It is friendship but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesnt fit. Its more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. Upon her discovery that Michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to temp Sidney. Fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust. What a refreshment: Thank you Sidney. If you wouldve said yes I think Id have strangled you. I love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. But then the bubbly quirky beat starts up and Sidney goes off his stride matching the tune: dauntless. Where is Daphne? We dont really know - but they werent really in love and she wasnt really a scientist. He got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope. (Pollyanna) A contd relationship wouldve been nice but as Billy Joel says its more than Id hoped for... '\n",

      "418 'Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines in spite of the good box office returns. If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next STOP. Stop making our TV shows into these repellent stupid money grubbing waste of time movies that suck. By doing so you are proving one thing: Hollywood is out of ideas and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust. Whats next -- You guys gonna go & ruin The Bionic Man?? The film is just plain wrong and manages to get the most stupid simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting (or ignoring) that Tom Wopat & John Schneiders Bo & Luke Duke were *REFORMED* moonshiners. They had been busted learned their lesson gone straight and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen. Denver Pyles Uncle Jessie was also the moral center of the family always insisting that the Boys do good even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done. They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naiveté about them that was quite appealing. We wanted to be more like them than we were sorta. My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off which was apparently too moral for this film. By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering wisecracking criminally minded redneck baiting misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were -- Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys? I wanted to punch them both in the nose. They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who havent grown up. There should be no marijuana use no gawking at buxom nubile coeds & their breasts no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood. All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies. The problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show IMHO shouldnt be seeing this movie either and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money which is exactly how I feel. What were they thinking??? And boy did they *EVER* get Daisy wrong. Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom. She is hardly in the film at all (which is the movies only saving grace) and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive. Catherine Bachs Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her but the Daisy she played was a *PERSON*. The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it. She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home. And most importantly she was a sweet caring person who couldnt help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her. By contrast Jessica Simpson appears phony contrived made up costumed posed aloof bored out of place and I dont think she even looks that great in the outfit. She doesnt look like a person but a plot device conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent. Ms. Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened. Whatever the joke was she isnt in on it and is disgracefully exploited for T&A. If thats all she wants from her career executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least because this effort was just pathetic. The bottom line is SKIP IT. For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together. That was why it worked. The only real purpose I can see in the film might be its future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay. Twenty minutes of this & theyll be singing a choir. 1/10 and I mean it. And STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE BIONIC MAN you schnooks.'\n",

Soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictates) they should. Of course there are a lot of story points that dont add up. For example in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist a difficult feat since they apparently cant interact with physical matter. However minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the Tooth Fairy with them. Apparently they CAN sometimes move matter and sometimes they CANT. Go figure. Lots of blood and guts though...a few nice boobs. But this doesnt make up for the deficiencies. If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy go rent Darkness Falls.

Overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off. That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isnt terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter. Very few of the films gags are high-brow but they made me laugh. As I said the film has charm and charm can go a long way.  The characters are likable too. I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolins character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. Plus I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife (who serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable and theres never a scene where I thought to myself Why did he want to marry her in the first place? The ending is Hollywood-ish but it couldve been much more schmaltzy.  The cast is talented. I havent had a favorable view of most of Jason Lees mainstream work. I just loved him so much in Kevin Smiths films that I couldnt help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles. And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles. Even in this movie he doesnt look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why shes so damn likable. Of course shes a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality. In other words her beauty shows inside and out. I dont know the actresses name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small part and shes always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles. I loved her so much in Airplane and Lost in America that its a shame she doesnt get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills.  Dont be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. This is a funny charming film. Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so its always to see a good one among all these bad apples.

The concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie doesnt have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why. First you dont really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here its suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isnt the way to go here. I mean what is that? he looks like hes on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner its not natural Im surprised he didnt dislocate his jaw during filming.

Dealing with a ignorant dad didnt really help her much. Even though he loved her he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role. The love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also. I felt the passion the y had for one another. Then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream. I thought it ended just right.

I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Eberts review which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. I had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. Boy was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest most well-written movies I had ever seen. The screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out) but also in terms of character development. On my second viewing I began to realize that Mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. Their work plus Mamets extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It is truly a must-see.'\n",

Its the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus or pump iron for Jesus. Yeah Jesus was totally buffed liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. DUHHH! This movie should have been entitled Hiking for Jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help. The recent sports movie Invincible was 100 times more inspiring than this was and Jesus wasnt even a factor. It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream. Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda. One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior. But this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it. The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind. What does he do when he loses? Does he curse Jesus? Of course not! When he loses Jesus isnt responsible. Jesus is only responsible when he wins. And the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time!! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath. Materialism is not what Jesus taught. I find it odd that most so called Christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like Im standing still. Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey.

Teenage Lobotomy Sheena is a Punk Rocker and Blitzkrieg Bop are just a few of them. Next the cast truly gives it their all with Soles an ideal choice for the role of Riff; she is a true delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are earnest as Tom and Kate Woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful Togar Clint Howard has one of his best ever parts as washroom-occupying entrepreneur Eaglebauer and New World regulars such as Dick Miller Paul Bartel (particularly fun as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And of course its a treat to see The Ramones playing themselves. The movie has true spirit. The energy level is high with co-story author and director Allan Arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings. Theres also a great sense of humor. The paper airplane gag is a superb example of this. This extends right to the wipe style of scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable Rob Bottin in one of his earliest gigs. About as good as an authority-defying defend-ones-right-to-party film can get. Rock n Roll High School is quite simply a wonderful cult film. 8/10'\n",
      "487 'Towards the end of the movie I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good since theyre mostly seasoned professionals but if youre going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot with Buck Rogers the night stalker and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. Thats why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if theyre in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist. Also I know its a disaster movie but suspense doesnt have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after its first screening. I like Lee Grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)'\n",

Cheesy 80s music... cheesy dialogue... cheesy acting... and way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw I wont spoil it for you... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie youll thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something. A bunch of dim-bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because only a ninja can fight a ninja or something like that. Strange these guys dont seem to fight any better after their training than before... oh well the movie does move along pretty briskly. The fight scenes may not be great.. but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles.'\n",

Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward give possibly the best performances of their careers. And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern might have even toped him self with this one.

When Lori does not come home Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable.

Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others since its an independent low-budget film but cmon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying. Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film for example the mind numbingly weak acting (when its this bad you take another go at shooting the scene god damn it) the thing I found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script assuming such a thing existed during the production. There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her why dont you? The only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is as the rest of the film a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully. ",

This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of trying throughout the movie.  I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. Im sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those token English phrases thrown into a movie in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a great film it was a good film and the language did not seem put on.

I was puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive. I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacalls defense this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogarts last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. Of course part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. Malones performance outshines the rest although Jasper Hadleys weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally though I would have to say that Im just not much of a fan of melodrama. The cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes.'\n",

For those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their cousins who they apparently never knew about. It wasnt of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared. In this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along. That being said this isnt a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first. I thought the Darkheart character much more evil then the Nicholas of the first. But at the same time I felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears. I also liked the we care part at the end although I know other people had mixed feelings about that scene. And of course I LOVED the songs. My favorites being Growing Up and Forever Young. The care bears movies have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.'\n",

The film is based on a book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue who also directs the movie and writes the music score -of course. The film is a portrait of north Italian province life in the Emilia Romagna region. Were in 1975 the time of the first free radios -one of the boys of the movie creates Radioraptus. Youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes but the film speaks also about drugs -Freccia the main character is a victim of heroin slavery. Without being boring and moralist the story flows very well; the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well. Obviously Luciano Liga Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a movie professional first of all hes a musician. But he succeeds in making a good product. Unfortunately hell not repeat the success with his second movie Da zero a dieci -not good at all. In Radiofreccia actors are generally not very famous the only star is Stefano Accorsi -one of the most popular young Italian actors.

What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons cats fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway this is one strange pair Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother age 79) apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where were mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense except to them. They live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever (Look that cats going to the bathroom behind my portrait!) and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edies voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as eccentric and Id have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for wacked out of their gourds but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them.

I suppose if I had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who were unaware of what was going on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene; the shock and disbelief of the onlookers; and finally the silence.  On that day and even now I am reminded of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says `I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. It is amazing how it is so accurate in its description. There was truly a disturbance in the Force. This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance. The feelings are so incredibly visual. The anger the frustration the shock the fear the exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude. Its all there. Not a thing is missed.

Then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken yes thats right a chicken that pecks around the ground for chicken feed. The scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film but at least for me it was the films low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining. Ah! That is indeed the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes this is obvious but some have distribution problems and others of which this is one have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely garbage. It has very little going for it. The only performer worth having a look at is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum. He is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally bellows orders sashays with sword in hand and praises the chicken. I got so tired of hearing him talk about the soothing system as his means to cure the mentally sick.

No character really has an arc and when significant events do happen the viewer doesnt cared because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point. The film is all song and to that end the characters on end mouth the lyrics as theyre sung...the technique works for the first stanza it is done and is grating on the nerves after that. It doesnt feel real or fake it just feels unwelcome. Terrible acting with characters finding one mood and playing all of it. Poor lighting at times.

      "624 'A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs Fred Astaire Joan Fontaine and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns. Typically silly plot for an Astaire film has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen his secretary. They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right. He runs into Fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father. Silly plot. The great songs include A Foggy Day Things Are Looking Up Nice Work if You Can get It and I Cant Be Bothered Now. Fontaine does not sing but does a brief (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park. Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner Constance Collier Montagu Love Harry Watson (as Albert) Ray Noble and my favorite--Jan Duggan as the lead madrigal singer. Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings Nice Work if You Can Get It. Her facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a scene stealer in the W.C. Fields comedy The Old Fashioned Way playing Cleopatra Pepperday. Much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers who as noted elsewhere would have been hideously miscast. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes. Two more would-be disasters. Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to Astaire with ample comic relief by Burns and Allen. Fun film great songs good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!'\n",

The body-count is countless. Demons magic swords Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. A good Japanese flick for a rainy summer night.'\n",

Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world (and the violence in it) our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here but not flatly on the surface. You could technically call it a monster movie even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then its even up to you and your beliefs as to whats happening with the legendary spirit/beast. Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better.

Granted the costumes and staging was quite authentic but the Hollywood portrayal of this British Little Big Horn was truly boring. The amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history. Eveytime I heard triumphant background music begin I knew I had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler. Obviously the producers had invested heavily into staging and were determined to get their moneys worth. Despite the outstanding cast their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed. Whenever Peter Otoole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene I would cringe with disappointment. Their given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and the Bird Man of Alcatraz respectively. There are worse epics but this one is not much better.'\n",

However despite the A-grade B-movie cast and some good script ideas the movie plods along for some 73 minutes. Its a cheap-jack production all the way. Whats needed to off-set the poor production values is some imagination especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight location shots for example would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thick-ear material but Salkow treats it as just another pay-day exercise. Too bad that Brian Keiths typical low-key style doesnt work here coming across as merely wooden and lethargic at the same time cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. goes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. Clearly Salkow is no actors director. But youve got to hand it to that saucy little number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. Too bad she wasnt in charge. My advice-- skip it unless youre into ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50s fashion.'\n",

Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark. This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely. What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films. This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film. The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater. The sets show it is a limited budget film. The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift. Hoover wanted it changed. Instead it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year.'\n",

With the focus on a plot to assassinate the President of the United States a race against time and plenty of Secret Service agents the agency under the spotlight in The Sentinel. But wait the protagonist turns out to be Michael Douglas character Pete Garrison instead a veteran Secret Service agent famed for taking the bullet for Reagan in 1981. The SS agents are specially trained to take the bullet which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target? But Garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot. All this because of his failure in a polygraph test due to his adulterous banging of the First Lady (Kim Basinger). Tsk. There are shades of Clint Eastwoods In the Line of Fire. Both featured aging actors and aging veteran has-been heroes with a bit of a historical reference who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty. While Eastwoods movie has a more enigmatic villain in John Malkovich The Sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex-KGB villains and the mole within the Presidential Detail. With Douglas on the run from the law he becomes similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive hunting the proverbial one-armed man while at the same time relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents. Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria top TV stars of today from 24 and Desperate Housewives get relegated into support roles as the Secret Service investigators who are looking into Garrisons probable involvement in the assassination plot and at times seem to have lept off the pages of CSI with their forensics skills. The beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled X-Files Fox Mulder and Dana Scully but alas these two had very little to do here. We know the reason why theyre in the movie and that is to get their fans into the theatres. Also Longorias role seemed unable to shake off her sexy-mama Gabrielle and here has her in fairly low cut blouses (Sutherland actually tells her to cover up) and tight pants (ogle-fest for fellow agents). Nonetheless its still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world and the typical threats that they face daily including the following up on every nutcases threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world. Its a decent suspense and investigative thriller with enough subplots to keep you entertained. But one thing though like most ending action sequences this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through.'\n",

I mean hes Batman for Gods sake! I know the comic books I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batmans allies besides Robin but still... making Batman say that he needs help from them... What he cant handle a few punches? In BTAS he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem... Hes getting old? Come on... And another thing: I really dont think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon without years of hard training. One its irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible) and two its not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to them. Batman - The Animated Series made history with its animation its stories and its characters... That really was a legend of Batman.

The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer. Ive heard her re-tell them many times. Ive inquired her about a lot of things and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to. Ive read the entire book written about Raider Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas. There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis killings maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives. Im going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my moms portrayal of him all my readings on him and the video tapes Ive seen of him talking. First of all the camera angles were horrible. It looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I couldnt even bear to watch it. Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a very anal man and was a follow the rule book kind of guy. He wasnt as nice as the movie made him look he was very polite and abrupt business like. Same goes for his killings as far as we all know. If youve seen his confession in court you can already guess. And as for the obsession with the slaughter house? No. Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs. In fact he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods. Yet through-out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victims faces and acting like he cared about the well-being of them. Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew he confessed this but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also. I really dont even want to go in to this movie and Im already ranting. This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK. This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scenes served the side then this is your kind of movie.'\n",

The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. Im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing.

Instead give writer-director Ida Lupino much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood.

Although much of the casts acting is pedestrian at best Mala Powers who at the time was eighteen or nineteen gives an excellent performance throughout as the traumatized young woman Ann who tries to run away from her shame. Based on her work in this film Im surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career. Tod Andrews too has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her. Ms Lupino obviously working on a limited budget was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys leading to the rape and the police lineup following it. And she created a bittersweet ending which left me wondering if Ann really could ever have a normal life again.'\n",

Macy Tracy Ullman John Ritter Neve Campbell Donald Sutherland Barbara Bain David Dorfman. Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. Panic is the story of a hit man Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter) telling only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room he meets a young woman (Campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist. This is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mothers knowledge who kills to please his father but also cant stand up to him and quit. His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and its finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. When its time for Panic to moves it does - quickly. Panic doesnt seem panicked at all. In fact it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because its poorly made - the slowness is deliberate mirroring Alexs own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. By making a decision about Sara the Campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they dont jive. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche Sammys. William Macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated. This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. Its too adult too small too subtle too character-driven and too good.'\n",

Celebrities party endlessly they like to be seen at these parties and to get due exposure in the media. In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this. IMO there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a I need you you need me kind of relationship. However the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa. Anyhow in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column (page 3 of the newspaper) reporter Konkana Sen Sharma. She is shown as this celebrity maker very popular at the social gatherings. She has a good friend in the gay Abhijeet and in the struggling model Rohit (Bikram Saluja). She rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) and a struggling actress - Gayatri (Tara Sharma). The editor of the newspaper is Boman Irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by Atul Kulkarni. The movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level. The rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios exploitation of power hunger for media exposure. Into all this is layered in homosexuality a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot rampant drug use pedophilia police encounter deaths. In light of all this Pearls desire to have a super rich husband a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car the bitching women all seem benign ills. The film has absolutely excellent acting by Konkana Sen Sharma Atul Kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion. But the supporting cast is more than competent (Boman Irani is very good). This is what saves the film for me. Mr. Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash. I wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively. He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful. We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood theme party the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a Western beat. I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients. The film is a brave (albeit flawed) effort certainly worth a watch.'\n",

Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the familys new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to life by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted modern-day spin on the TV series Lassie - it might easily have been entitled A Boy and His Zombie - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door) the sterility of suburban life the corporate control of civic affairs small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie doesnt hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead this is a low-keyed subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950s itself and the cheesy low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. KSun Ray Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones) while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse. This is what Lassie might have been had Timmys best friend been afflicted rabies.'\n",

Women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China. This makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture. The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performance. A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.'\n",

Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious.

We are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. Seen as we have watched her on Sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus. Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice Melissa works with David Lascher in this well before he took the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again. Hopefully MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in more TV Movies sort of like Kellie Martin who has always shined in TV Movies. Lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart you shine always Melissa!!!'\n",

I saw it theatrically at the age of nine and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film.  The film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. The earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film. This update is more epic and cinematic. Still I thoroughly recommend both films. This film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever Shadow; the sharp sarcastic Himalayan cat Sassy; and the young fun-loving American Bulldog Chance. The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche Sally Field and Michael J. Fox respectively. There is virtually nothing offensive in the film. There is a bit of scatological humor but nothing extreme. No hard violence save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall an angry porcupine and a dark railroad shaft. Hilarious scary moving and above all real it surprised me to see that this film didnt win any awards not one. Nevertheless I will have to say this is just as good as some of the Best Picture nominees nowadays.'\n",

There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed. Gods love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal. There is the love in a marriage. While the main character grapples with his wifes disease he realizes through Gods love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally you have the love of child and parent. The kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear. Dear friends love is not love unless it comes from God because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love does no good unless it is given to another.

Perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated but because it is slow. Even with a slow story Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters.

      "805 'The main problem I see with this film is its score which screams with every note This is a cheap-ass movie. Theres not much more to say here. The score just plain sucked. The second problem which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots if you will) is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman) in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here. The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience. The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The main point of her performance that didnt seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon Barbeau. To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole. Finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie. So whats my holistic grading of this piece? Id give it a solid C+ to B- depending upon how much credit youre inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit fizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performance. All in all this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a Nazi you love. :)'\n",

Well THE BARBARIANS is remarkably trashy action/adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN and fails at every level. The look of the film is all wrong. Some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy tacky disco look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesnt make any sense whatsoever even for a low budget flick like this one. Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume. Hes supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon. And its funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN appear in her first movie walking around in skimpy fur bikini. Im sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called Barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but its almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really ill-conceived. The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass while the other twins loincloth barely covers his muscular butt. Im not kidding! Dont ask me whos who though. Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film. And his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick. Its just bad.'\n",
      "812 'This is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word horror in order for it to be appreciated. The main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily. Mainly because he simply doesnt understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him. From watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesnt. Also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the film that the family is from the city. Also in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer then get held up then they argue with the locals about it and the little boy surely didnt find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all. The Wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this. There is the American Indian legend but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically. Not because thats what the Wendigo actually is but because that is how he understands it. When you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it. Obviously it was low-budget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general eeriness more than make up for it. And the final question the film asks is: is it all in your head or is it really out there? 8/10 Rated R: profanity violence and a sex scene'\n",

Its a shame really as Ive started to watch these shows on the Chiller network (I never saw the originals) I realized how different and interesting it really was.  Starring Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak a reporter for the International News Service and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss Tony Vincenzo the show followed the exploits of a Chicago news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night. The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart. A somewhat goofy guy who always wears the same suit you cannot help but love him. His jokes are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor Oakland are downright hilarious.  The stories are for the most part pretty good and the acting is very good.

Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. Occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. That is the premise of the film entitled  The Night Listner. It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles. Perhaps its because his show is losing its authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his and best friend (Joe Morton) he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. It is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter (Rory Culkin). In reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents Noon is captivated and wants to help. However things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop this might be comical.

With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation B flic about inner city girl gangs. Much to my surprise it wasnt about that at all. Instead it is a well acted well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesnt really want to be a boxer (only following through on their fathers wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead.  The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. For starters her brothers coach doesnt want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences. All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of.

Somehow I managed to keep putting this one off which is strange because its probably the most popular and well received one.

The plot (which was pretty much lifted in the film Black Roses) concerns a mulleted misfit named Eddie whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music.

Once Eddie plays the record backwards he discovers hes a bit tougher and bad things start happening to those who taunt him. Is Sammis music possessed? Trick or Treat is well-made and a total hoot. The special effects are awesome even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams. I grew up in the 80s and while I wasnt a fan of heavy metal I do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of Satan worshipping. Haha! I also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshipped Satan so its very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio DJ and a anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this film as a kid! While the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal the viewer never really finds out why Sammi Curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way.

Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police here the Mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her. Before finally catching up with her son a lot of bizarre things happen. The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Childrens Play at a community theater. She gets caught and then realizes it is not her child. That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial. However in this movie the Mom is release after a couple of hours because the victims parents feel sorry for her. A little while later Mom breaks into her mother-in-laws house and then the Police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her (and feel sorry for her?). At another point in the story they have found the child but when the Police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the Dad kept around just for such an emergency escape! The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft and even though it must have taken some time (in a real world) she and the lawyer-boyfriend and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall. Instead of getting out of the raft to search for the Dad on the land Mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket. Of course she cannot swim and sinks like a rock. The lawyer saves her but they miss a chance to run after the Dad. At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico. On and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows! In some ways this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive.

This time out its Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man. This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud. It was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with SNL skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man. He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible. Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt. After pushing the buttons of the station manager Leon along with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) gets fired and needs to find another job. Out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies. The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isnt signed. So Leon needs to track down all the women hes been with to find the woman of his dreams. But sometimes as Billy Dee Williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you. There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys whos wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy) then kill him. Leading this bunch of guys is surprise! Will Ferrell from SNL. First off I thought the sub-plot was rather lame. The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless. I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me. And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault. So back to the main story. The story basically centers around Leon and sex. So what it comes down to is if you dont like the character of Leon you wont like the movie. His voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie. I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows. I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL. The only thing I ever really liked of his was his Ladies Man skits. But the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host (remember the one with Cameron Diaz?) and they were short. For about 5 minutes they were pretty funny. And here for about 20 minutes its really funny. What I thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout. He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona. Until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up. Other than that it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was. There isnt a lot of substance to this movie if you couldnt guess. But like I said earlier the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny. Some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness. The problem of course with this movie and most other SNL spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time. Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult. That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour. When it was good it was good but when it wasnt good it got to be boring. So overall The Ladies Man wasnt as bad as other SNL films but it wasnt as good as others. It had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on. There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film. The bottom line is if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character youll be able to watch the film. If he annoys you dont even bother going. Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing.  '\n",
      "866 'I first heard about this film about 20 years ago when I was a kid in grade school(!) it just so happened that I was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies (or cinema I dont remember) were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn. It really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page (it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it). About 18 or so years later the public library here where I live had available for checkout the whole 4-DVD set of Treasures of American Film Archives released by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I was reading the notes on the DVD cases for the set I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years I could finally see the film! After viewing it it slightly wasnt was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film not that thats a bad thing but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic) but it was still an impressive film IMHO considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film including hand-tinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the films scenes (filmed off of a video monitor) giving it a more distressed lo-res look. Dont get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972. Thats why its still one of my favorite short/experimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well...'\n",

      "868 'Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouris book Forbidden Love and THAT was a best-seller. An onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman Lie$ is the very best in editorialised reality TV. Cleverly edited and colourful Broinowskis storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke. I disagree (with Variety) that its overlong; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others just-recorded testimonials. On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired.....so I watched it twice. This Oscar-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another. The apparent con unfolded in the Australian State of Queensland via very personal swindles of Khouris friends and fans(!). Clearly these friends are now turned the funniest on-camera line belonging to Khouris QLD neighbour Rachel Richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat no-nonsense colloquialisms: I think its a load of sh!t. Personally. We need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers. Any perennial lie-spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie.  Theres some breathtaking footage of Khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian who instead presses her (con)Artist repeatedly for corroboration. Since being busted by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after publication Khouri has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name. She absconded supposedly because a) shes either terrified of her sly more-Italian-sounding-than-Greek husband or b) because she needed her passport/visas to clear her name.  Unlikely. A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained her trail in Queensland before she again skipped overseas (one guess: No not Jordan). According to a closing card Khouri is still under investigation by the FBI in 2007. I guessed audiences might just give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge. Instead the audiences I sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen. Once they caught on there was plenty counter-derision and catcalls; earlier stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didnt know how to take Khouris evolving contradictions. The filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything out--not even her own self-sacrifice. Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by Khouri herself. The putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first--key to how a lifelong liar operates: in half-truths. Khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr-old with rather disarming charm and surprisingly worked-out biceps. Gradually were introduced to less-and-less-adulating Aussie journos publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of Khouris honour-killing accusations hook line and sinker. Later we see their more rueful reactions quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact if some perhaps a little bitter. It was Jordanian (anti-)honour-killing activists who took deepest umbrage at Khouris fallacies because its pot-stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change. Honour-killings do happen in Jordan; its just their prevalence thats at odds with Khouris book--plus 72 other facts. In 2003 these activists faxed (Australian) Random House with 73 painstakingly-checked objections. The publishing houses across 4 continents whod jumped at the chance to publish first-time author Khouri never tried to check any facts. Leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract they too were fair game. So a massive hot-topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in Internet cafes. Later still were shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to Khouris bio as well. For one thing shes not only not a 35yr-old virgin (her defence is that she merely didnt disabuse people of their assumptions) but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes shes just too fast-talking in her American accent. She also seems too-comfortable with cellphone technology and Western clothes. I realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very Jordanian women who dont need any Western paternalism from me but when even cultural cues dont jibe in addition to Khouris facts youve got to start questioning your source. At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. She makes an admirable effort to hold Khouri to account in person in Jordan. The last third is consumed with a fact-finding trip back to Amman where one fact after another falls. Eventually Broinowski forces her (con)Artist to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story and its after this that Khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera. Secret because in it Khouris American security guard Jeremy is heard to have an Australian accent: hes an actor! (We never find out how Anna uncovered it.)  So this becomes the filmmakers triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment. Her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt FBI documents--and Khouris most shocking initial crime. Anna Broinowski (watch-list her now) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device (key players cross-commenting on footage) to kill two birds--making her audiences want to drink from the same well again. In fact despite her deceptively demure approach she made me re-confirm that Overington and Knox really DID win their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their Norma Khouri Investigation. Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.(10/10)'\n",

New audiences had rediscovered the pairs comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on childrens interest. It was to be expected. But how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... I cant even think of a word. Im sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival but you cant inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and thats where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was someones first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy Im sure that viewer would dismiss the original duos reputation as senility gone amok. The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. And you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie.'\n",

It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days journey from London and law and order was much harder to enforce. Sadly this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The acting and production values are OK but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful. Why do television adaptations do this? Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story??? One of lifes great mysteries!!! The BBC made an excellent version which was televised at Christmas in the early 1990s which I am still trying to track down a copy of! Take my advice read the book and dont bother with this paltry version!'\n",

      "881 'Im not a fan of Adam Sandler. In fact I dont think Ive ever liked him in anything Ive seen him in. The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears. There was Adam Sandler playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around New York City on a motor scooter looking pitiful and lost. Typical Sandler-type loser character again I thought. I almost gave up then and there. But then as I stuck with this I actually discovered something I never knew before: Adam Sandler can act! He is truly outstanding in this movie as Charlie a lost and lonely figure whose entire family (including the dog) was killed in one of the hijacked planes on 9/11 and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result. Don Cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with Charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better. Of course Cheadles Alan Johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties. The two of them made a completely believable team and Sandler in particular made Charlie real working through his emotions and feelings. This is not a Sandler comedy. If your looking for that go to some of his other sillier stuff. This is a pretty heavy movie - sometimes sad sometimes hopeful and always engrossing. There are some funny parts in it. I loved the scene in which Charlie convinces Alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college and then the conversation the two of them have afterward. I personally didnt think that Saffron Burrows added much to the movie as Donna an obviously needy patient of Johnsons. The only reason for the character seemed (based on one flashback) to be that she looked eerily like Charlies late wife but that was never really developed and I just didnt care that much for the character. Do look for the part of the judge however played by Donald Sutherland who I thought nailed the part bang-on. As far as Im concerned though this is Sandlers movie and kudos to him for a great performance. Definitely his best in my opinion. 8/10'\n",

The first 3 American Pies were hilarious the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. As you figured out from the title of the movie Beta House is about a fraternity freshmen girls and the most original part of them all falling in love. Of course the guy that has his way with the chicks is Stifler who along with his mates tries to complete another apparently impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. Its just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To sum it up: awful acting + dull script + wrong use of the American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls like 2 funny scenes :)'\n",

According to his extremely rich father Arthur has to marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson or hes cut off from the family money ($750 million dollars worth). The problem is Arthur doesnt love Susan (though I hear she makes some good chicken) and has just fallen head-over-heels for the waitress and part-time shop-lifter Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting fellow. Hes really just a big kid born into riches with at least one person looking after him every second of every day. Working just rubs Arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun womanize and of course drink. Drinking gives Arthur a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble its absolutely hilarious to watch on screen.  Dudley Moore is great here in this film as Arthur earning an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold but he is also great in bringing Arthur down to a relatable level and making the character likable. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina the spirited nobody who Arthur cant get enough of and John Gielgud is terrific as Arthurs butler Hobson. Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in this film and theres no doubting why. Hobson has a stone-solid dry wit and stuck up attitude but hes always looking out for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordons 1981 film Arthur is short and simple but delivers laughs a-plenty.'\n",

Nair good as usual effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti-islam hysteria that swept--and still sweeps--the states. i did find Gitais piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in its critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism and Penns piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes though i had expected to like it. Borgnine is very good and brave in it. SPOILER WARNING: one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character; my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what because light floods his room keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize. again this is a sort of impressionistic piece for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this mans flat then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash not light flooding through his window.'\n",

      "927 'The Wicker Man starring Nicolas Cage is by no means a good movie but I cant really say its one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination etc. but its just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead heres five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man even though its bad:  5. Its hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based. 4. For a cheesy horror/thriller it is really aesthetically pleasing. Its pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie. 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether youre a fan of his or not it seems as if its impossible for Cage to play a normal guy. There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man but in the most wonderful kind of way. 2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. See? you could write this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society! Also the similarities between this Summersisle society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting. 1. If youre reading this theres probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of highlights from the movie including Cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!! line. These scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the films entirety. I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out its about a dollar per reason. Its a pretty good deal. NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and its better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue which features a cameo from James Franco.'\n",

MST3000 made its living off that. If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959 youll have the handle on this sucker. All the elements are there: the pseudoscience occasionally logical more often hilariously infantile. The adolescent boy attitude toward sex with the gigolo captain (good call on that one guys!) making eyes at the buxom scientist with hair so red its a wonder it doesnt set off the fire alarms. The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so alien that everything glows red yet one alien monster has a mouse face and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a kids toy. The comic relief an overweight astronaut (!) who sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun. And of course the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. If these people had met E.T. they would have roasted him in two seconds flat! OW indeed! Dont get me wrong. I rated this movie low. Still its never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous) and you have to admit in your little kid core it makes you jump a few times.  Okay then dont admit it. I guess you were never 10.'\n",

The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man/ killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He disslikes this job but does it because Rooney payed for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children are unaware that this is his job and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him he is placed in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. They rob abanks and much more and build a bond. Theyre the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.'\n",

The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnies in the T films (and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same). So to the film itself a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other. Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly. If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I dont think you will be disappointed.'\n",

This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude. As a native Texan I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy) but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it.

But unfortunately theres no the end. As for me its unacceptable. I was thinking... how it will be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ...and I have some idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little bit different. Im sure that 3rd part without Helmer wouldnt be the same. So heres my suggestion. Mayble little bit stupid maybe not. I know that Lars likes to experiment. So why not to make small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (like for example team America by Trey Parker) or even computer 3d animation. I know its not the same as real actors but in principle I believe it could work... only this way its possible to make actors alive again. For Riget fans this shouldnt be so big difference - if the animation will be done in good way average watcher will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie. The most important thing now is the story. Its completely understandable that its not possible to create Riget 3 with the actors nowadays. So why not to play with animation? And... look for the possibilities that it gives to you! Even marketing one! Great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Just dreams? I hope to see Riget 3 someday... or even to see just the script. Im curious how the story ends... and as I expect- everybody here do. greets slaj ps: Im not talking about the kingdom hospital by Stephen King ;-)'\n",

      "1002 'Gillian Anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked. After recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revenge... I thought Straightheads was terrible. Violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant. If I didnt dislike the phrase a great deal I would call Straightheads a video nasty. Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly I dont know how Straightheads got a cinema release. I am not a prude. I dont mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterisation or c) preferably both. Straightheads had neither. No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid. Luckily Straightheads went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. It was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film. She especially is very underrated (and is still particularly fit). If you want to see a good British revenge movie rent or buy Shane Meadows Dead Mans Shoes. It is a little masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen his This Is England instead. Ce sera sera...'\n",

      "1005 'Essentially a story of man versus nature this film has beautiful cinematography the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantations foreman played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finchs late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way. The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch.'\n",

In addition Im also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter. However after watching it I was extremely disappointed. The movies pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. The director lingered on certain scenes for much too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was barely any dialogue. Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie you didnt feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything. The script was weak the acting was poor and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which captures your attention maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by. This movie felt as though it would never end. Dont waste your money on this movie.'\n",

I HIGHLY recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in French are quite good because you dont have to speak French to get it (although if you do it is still hilarious). Also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great but funny the first time. Skip over those if you can. Its almost not worth watching. However this really is a funny funny stand-up show that everyone should see. I was dead at the time!'\n",
      "1018 'Ive always been enthusiastic about period dramas an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past. This presentation of Byron was unbelievable. Unbelievably bad! The script was dreadful the acting uninspired and all the characters woefully insipid. Apparently Byron was mad bad and dangerous to know and set the ladies hearts all-a-flutter. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked with a limp. This portrayal of the man was just limp all over. I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life. Not a splutter not even a glimmer. It was utter tedium if not downright boredom from start to finish. Having the opinion that no-one will ever better the Bard of Avon I also believe that Byrons poetry is over-revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment. I think the BBC lost its nous with this one'\n",

      "1020 'Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of Owen Wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.'\n",

      "1022 'The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and wasnt intended to be a sequel to Demons as Lamberto Bava even mentions it on the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80s rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror Demons III: The Ogre is a architectural horror so thats how Demons III isnt a proper sequel to Demons but I still like this film. The music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in The Ogre is another thing why I like the film. There are two other films that are classed as Demons III and that is Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good film as long as you dont compare it with Demons and Demons 2.'\n",

      "1024 'I saw this film when I was a young child on television (thank-you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards. Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislav Pojar one of Canadas National Film Boards best animators. Pojar was in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see Night Angel. The symbolism is obvious but deftly used. The oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda. What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small room where the action takes place is the characters entire world. The invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world. Beautiful and haunting film. I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by Trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids. A must see.'\n",
      "1025 'Recap: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy knowledge that might unbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union. KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology. So they sets a scheme in motion. During a rescue attempt to free Markov KGB steps in takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden and working for the UN. As a backup KGB kidnaps Markovs estranged daughter. CIA now send their best agents a team of (Swedish?) Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. Comments: A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing. The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas. First off is that it is very dark probably to conceal locations and bad effects that some scenes are hard to comprehend. You cant see what is happening. The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts despite being a ninja-movie. Sure there are some of quite poor quality but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions. The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies. What does it have that speaks for it then? The idea and ambition foremost. Some actually and especially for a Swedish movie decent action-scenes albeit not of martial arts. Some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode. Mostly all parts that you look for in a B-movie. Because it definitely is a B-movie no mistake could be made there. But if you expect it and watch it like a B-movie it is entertaining. But dont forget it is not only a B-movie it is set in the eighties. Some girls for example besides wearing... lets say interesting clothes have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup. In all see for the cult status and the ambition. Enjoy it and then forget it. 4/10'\n",

A man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the lurch. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling over in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Recognize him? But its historically interesting to see the roots of Rock n Roll. Also interesting is Ewells introduction to CinemaScope a new format at the time.'\n",

Case in point: mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfastmom stops for gas crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the B&B try to rape her. She escapes heads to B&B and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts. Wow. Other action logic deficits abound. Acting is also lukewarm and the next door neighbors warning is delivered in a really corny badly acted moment. Moments of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interplay between characters. Less focus on gore more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated.'\n",
      "1039 'What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation. Spoiler of sorts follows. Poor Cedric; he apparently didnt know what hit him. Poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just didnt belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach. On a purely technical note I loved the camera action in this film. Subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my French is presque rien. I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished very professionally made motion picture. Though many scenes seem superfluous I rate it nine out of ten.'\n",

      "1041 'And yet another run of South Park comes to an end. This wasnt as strong an episode as Id hoped for but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finisher then Stanleys Cup Tsst Bloody Mary or Erection Day. It still cant hold a candle to Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks but few episodes can. Night of the Living Homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre done in a way only South Park would think of. Instead of flesh eating zombies the entities are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of it. Randy and other residents are locked in the Community Center though this time on the roof where they can survey the scene. A particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone and becomes homeless leaving Randy no choice but to shoot him. Meanwhile the four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message but being seriously uninspired. South Park is at its best a lot of the times when it is being ridiculous. Matt and Trey played it safe this week and didnt really critique the homeless problem just lampooned it. The shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless. This is the first time a suicide on South Park goes wrong and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies. Another inspired South Park moment. Overall the episode was funny but it was kept from being great by withholding any real commentary on the homeless and sticking straight with the zombie shtick. The ending is somewhat funny but nothing new. Now we must wait until October for the next batch of episodes. Its a long haul but South Park must be applauded for its run. The show seemed to be running out of steam last season but now its back in full form.'\n",

      "1044 'Its not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but 1969s Midnight Cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late 1960s when American films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The films cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain. The meandering plot follows Joe Buck a naive young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical sickly petty thief named Ratso Rizzo who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile Rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic. In his first major role Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joes paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean post-college image from The Graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesingers film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the characters fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner. The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later which features comments from Hellman Hoffman Voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voights screen test; Controversy and Acclaim which examines the genesis of the movies initial X rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director Celebrating Schlesinger.'\n"
