    "1\\. From your reading you know that the naive Bayes classifier works by calculating the conditional probabilities of each feature, $e_i$, occuring with each class $c$ and treating them independently. This results in the probability of a certain class occuring given a set of features, or a piece of evidence, $E$, as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c \\mid E) = \\frac{p(e_1 \\mid c) \\cdot p(e_2 \\mid c) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot p(e_k \\mid c) \\cdot p(c)}{p(E)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional probability of each piece of evidence occuring with a given class is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(e_i \\mid c) = \\frac{\\text{count}(e_i, c)}{\\text{count}(c)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation $\\text{count}(e_i, c)$ is the number of documents in a given class that contain feature $e_i$ and $\\text{count}(c)$ is the number of documents that belong to class $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common variation of the above is to use Laplace (sometimes called +1) smoothing. Recall the use of Laplace smoothing introduced toward the end of Chapter 3 in the section Probability Estimation. This is done in sklearn by setting `alpha=1` in the `BernoulliNB()` function (this is also the default behavior). The result of Laplace smoothing will slightly change the conditional probabilities,\n",

    "As we all know Naive Bayes uses conditional probability and to calculate that we need count(c) that is count of the occerence of event c. If in case we did not have event c in our training data but we encounter one in the testing data then c will be labelled as 0. As per the conditional probability formula, count(e,c)/ count(c) will give answer 0. Therefore as the algorithm has never learnt it, the new word will be classified wrongly. For eg, if we have a set of words which are classified as spam or ham. And in the test data we encounter with a new word say \"password(which is a part of spam)\" which is not a part of the training data then that word will be wrongly classified as ham. In order to classifiy it correctly we perform Laplace smoothing (usually k = 1) on it and hence the count of every word increases by 1. Hence the word \"password\" will be correctly classified as spam.\n"

    "Logistic Regression (tfidf) model performs better than the Naive Bayes model. Naive bayes assumes that every parameter is mutually independent which is why it assigns equal weight to even those features which are correlated to each other. Whereas, Logistic Regression assigns them lower weights. As the plot of logistic regression is better, we can infer that there are correlated features in our dataset. Also, the dataset is huge. The Logreg model might have overfitted if the dataset was small, resulting in lower performance. TFIDF Vectorizer performs better thatn Count Vectorizer since CV only counts the word frequencies whereas TFIDF considers the word frequencies as well as the number of times that word is used in the document, i.e., tfidf vectorizer gives less importance to words which are repeated several times. Both binary and tfidf NB has a similar plot. We use binary vectorizers in which all the non-zero counts are converted to 1. This makes both the models behave similar to Bernoulli Naive Bayes model giving the same output."

The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He couldnt have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible -- he had made the error not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person. A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one=sided stories so that they dont have to think.'\")\n",

I admire it even more for that considering its WAY more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood churns out every year. Too bad this didnt get a theatrical release; I dont know about anyone else but I would have went to see it in theatres. `Doctor Mordrid is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy especially if theyre into sci-fi like I am. I dont see why this is a R-rated film; only one f-word is said and there are no gruesome death scenes nor is there any blood at all. The timeless rivalry between sorcerers Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race while Kabal wanted to enslave them) gave the story a sense of enchantment while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself. Basically this a film thats just plain fun to watch. There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie though: seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit. That makes me laugh every time I see it. But I digress... Anyway the acting is great; the main protagonists (Anton and his lady friend Samantha) are very likable; Anton is sympathetic and hospitable and Samantha is friendly. Plus the settings were wonderful. The floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; were only given a glimpse of it twice though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here. The main setting was also very neat; Antons apartment is very roomy and he has some cool devices especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the worlds occurrences. He even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named Edgar. Overall this a great film; it was fun to watch and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles. If you can find anywhere that rents `Doctor Mordrid you should rent it (or in my case buy it. It was definitely money well-spent)! My Rating: 8 stars out of ten. '\")\n",

Not as good as say QUIZ SHOW CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart.

If you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy you wont like this film. It is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it.  Dropping for the time being the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters we see Einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a United Nations hell-bent for nukes being visited by Marylin Monroe after filming the notorious Seven Year Itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggio. They have a lovely interplay in which Einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times.  Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a Red. He is determined to extract Einsteins assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unamerican Activities Committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as Gary Busey who hates Marylins exhibitionism and believes Einstein has become her lover even though Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the Special Theory of Relativity.  But theres more.  Just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks. It is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today. Finally we see the shocking terror of Einsteins vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. Insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time. It is utterly amazing.'\")\n",

      "(33, \"'The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle. At first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity-themed morality comedies of Cecil B. De Mille but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture. Even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense. As well as being a student of the German Expressionist style the rhythmic editing style of Sergei Eisenstein had had its impact upon Hitchcock. But here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery. This is apparent from the opening shots where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo. And like Eisenstein the editing style seems to suggest sound \\xc2\\x96 for example when a split-second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring. There is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the US in that The Ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards. As much as possible is conveyed by imagery and Hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip-read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters speech. And its not done by contrived symbolism or overacting its all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with point-of-view shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances. There are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices (particularly double exposures) many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in The Lodger. Lets make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors. First up the stunningly handsome and very talented Carl Brisson in the lead role. In spite of his talent I was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist! But that just goes to show how much I know as it turns out Brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting. Playing his rival is the competent Ian Hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s. The most demanding role in The Ring has to be that given to Lillian Hall-Davis torn between two lovers. She pulls it off very well however with an emotive understated performance and its a shame her career never lasted in the sound era. And last but not least the great Gordon Harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role. The Rings climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent-era Hitchcock. Martin Scorcese may have had his eye on The Ring when he directed the fight scenes in Raging Bull as his watchword for these scenes was Stay inside the ring. The fight in The Ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action intensifies Hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with close-ups and point-of-view shots. Hitchcocks aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the characters fear or paranoia. The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger. Its a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features.'\")\n",

Everyday items such as crates boxes metal containers etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects dart by Burtynskys camera. He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them that is. Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynskys lens (but didnt we already know that from Wall-E?). He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places) with their uniform clothing and robotic movements become part of the industrial landscape. Manufactured Landscapes a documentary about Burtynskys work has much of the feel of a Koyaanisqatsi about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns. Indeed director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China a dockyard in Bangladesh and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China. With their fluid camera-work the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynskys images. In fact the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the themes of his work which quite frankly come out sounding confused contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best. But it is as a purely aesthetic experience highlighting image and form that Manufactured Landscapes resonates most. In the case of Burtynsky perhaps a picture really IS worth a thousand words.'\")\n",

Once again with these films the plot is of a minor consequence - Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and Rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime-a-dance music hall. Although their relationship is bright and fun to watch they are bogged down by an un-involving main story of Hilliard and Randolph Scott not succeeding in finding any chemistry between them.  Although it was a last minute decision Hilliard was rather miscast in this as she doesnt have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout. The film may have benefited in promoting Lucille Balls wise-cracking worldy brassy character to a larger role as she simply shined in every small scene and would have made a great Helen Broderick-type side-kick to Rogers in this kind of bright film (See Stage Door made the following year for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). That Scotts one-dimensional Neanderthal character eventually falls in love with Hilliards is even harder to believe than Astaire being in the Navy!  Now onto the important part the singing and dancing: Nothing more can be said about Lets Face the Music and Dance other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and I often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes. However other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well; Im putting all my Eggs in One Basket is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of Astaire and Rogers and almost pokes fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous perfectly synchronized dancing. Other highlights are Id Rather Lead the Band and Let Yourself Go which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together. I nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) time we see Astaire brilliantly play on the piano; It seems this mans talents were endless! Overall I actually prefer this to Top Hat and Swing Time (although only just) as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved it is hard to dislike the fun factor.'\")\n",

Thats quite surprising considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work. The Fourth Man is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and Im never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In The Fourth Man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which theres plenty) but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldnt get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. Theres hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story.  Nevertheless when you can cope with Verhoevens pretty obvious satiric approach its quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb\\xc3\\xa9 in particular.

Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglens face. The former prizefighter who once faced Joe Louis in the ring delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. The plot is gracefully simple: In 1922 Dublin a starving and humiliated man whos been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant. For \\xc2\\xa320 he betrays a friend to the Tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions.  It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the films most impressive achievement. In most movies a burly lout of Gypos type would be cast as the heavy hed have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown. In The Informer Gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience. Because Liam OFlahertys novel had previously been filmed in 1929 RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglens Oscar The Informer also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score.'\")\n",

      "(155, \"'By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hungs `Encounters of the Spooky Kind Chow Yun Fat in John Woos iconic `A Better Tomorrow `Zu Warriors and the classic `Mr Vampire. Jackie Chan was having international success on video but it was with `A Chinese Ghost Story that HK cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the West for many years. Western filmgoers had never seen anything like it. It was a film that took various ingredients that HK cinema had used for years (flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural) and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution. Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and best. Director Siu-Tung Ching (still best known as an Action Choreographer on such films as Woos `A Better Tomorrow 2/The Killer) has under the watchful eye of legendary Producer Tsui Hark created a masterpiece of Fantasy/Horror cinema. And with such an expert crew at his disposal (no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators) the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable. The editing by the amazingly prolific David Wu (who wrote/directed `The Bride With White Hair 2 and edited such classic titles as `A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 `Hardboiled and the cult hit `The Club) is quite simply a work of genius. His crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best HK cinema has ever created. Fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their art. The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles. This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting. Where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an ever-present ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold. Its a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. Even the silken robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen. Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale. The production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. Another major factor to the films success is the music by Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on `A Chinese Ghost Story the music is quite simply vital. From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters. The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments. Drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but its in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into its own. Here; flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an HK film. Add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over Tsau-shens and Hsiao Tsings love making (nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful. This is lovingly innocent movie romance) and you have a shining example of the power a films music can have. And we of course have the acting talent. Leslie Cheung (`A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 and a very popular singer) is outstanding as the innocent tax collector. His work in the (thankfully mild) comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence. Joey Wang (who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the Chow Yun Fat/Andy Lau classic God of Gamblers) has never looked more radiant than how she does here. She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is stunning. She shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma (`Mr. Vampire `Swordsman) is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy Yen. He treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease. And what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable. But what about the monsters and beasties? I hear you cry. Well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion/animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting Tsau-shen) to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective Lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work. Most of which has to this day never been topped. But the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirits killer tongue. We first encounter this thing with an `Evil Dead style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal French kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks. But later its shown in all its crazy glory. It can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils its slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks!! It can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth! Its an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldnt work. But it does to fantastic and unforgettable effect. So what all this adds up to is a classic example of Hong Kong movie making. A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie. Its a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to its enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances.'\")\n",

I watched it quite a while ago but Ill tell you whenever I hear certain music from this anime I am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling I got when watching it and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didnt explain things properly but it didnt ruin any part of the viewing experience. I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and I found all my answers and a whole lot more. I love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(Ive always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) I do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. Id recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action. Also even though this was based on a H-game it doesnt have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way.(I have no problem with mature anime in most cases I prefer it)'\")\n",

For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The moms problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20000. Ouch. She cant come up with the money because she just got fired. OK...JUST is the key word in that sentence. What the...? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? Maybe it wouldve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think? Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isnt a limit on the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was borrowing it from. The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Sadly those dumb parents watching the game dont think its at all strange. Hmm. Anyway Id like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. Youll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her. Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer.

      "(169, \"'I suppose that any novel thats as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find much favor with Depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence.  In fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it not that too much of it was kept for the film. We first meet Ahab Creely (hes got a last name and a brother) as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett who is Father Mapples daughter. That brother Derek played by Lloyd Hughes also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab in an over the top performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in. We see Ahab lose his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome. Of course this was all before the Code. Still Im sure 1930 audiences shuddered. After that the story of Ahabs hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in Joan Bennetts eyes. That is not exactly Melvilles motivation in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. One of the things Melville did was invest the crew of Ahabs ship the Pequod with personalities. Other than Queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. Id see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.'\")\n",

I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong. The plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel youd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book. Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesnt show up at all. I hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner. My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur.

Mmm\\xc2\\x85 to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths. Anyhow by the end of While She Was Out I was left feeling rather indifferent. Not the worse (despite being engulfed by negatives) but theres easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park. The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material (taken from a short story) along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thought-out (which isnt so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off) so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons (led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon) terrorizing Basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand (dont ask me why?) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didnt elicit tension or emotion\\xc2\\x85 but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up.

But whatever chances youre ready to give to Cama de Gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: its an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence (and theyre made to look like closeted gays too) made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (countem) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and its not even funny-bad. Weve all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong -- theres gang-rape spanking murder the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially Kids and Bully) but Clarks films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap. I dont think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesnt care a bit about technique (the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling) but hes a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms hes bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT).  Despite his megalomaniac ambitions Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he cant even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc). Damn he cant even decide WHERE to put his camera (theres use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it. Its very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineos Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in Carandiru Lavoura Arcaica Proibido Proibir). Here hes told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped actors in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn). The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what hes trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE theyre middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldnt tell).  With its dogmatic self-righteousness headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom Cama de Gato is bad for a 1000 reasons but above all its harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument.

Thirdly it has several surprisingly strong performances including Jay Mohr as a wily crook Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady and Cheech Marin (yes the dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) as a musical immigrant. It might not be a classic but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.'\")\n",

The other one I remember is the one where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead(complete with funeral and mourners). I dont remember why he plays dead or how the show ends.

The problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects. Granted this was 1933 but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen Gary Cooper W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit humor and continuity are missing. What a pity! Its such a great book. I would recommend Disneys 1951 version.'\")\n",

This was one of my favorite childhood episodes one that really cemented my adoration of this show. However on viewing this episode after 20 years Id say it is definitely one of the lighter ones played for laughs and amusement instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this their first and best season. Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R&R too! As Mr. Spock would say the story just isnt logical but there are some amusing lines like of course Mr. Spocks final one at the end--when he asks the Captain McCoy et al whether they enjoyed their R&R and they answer in the affirmative he raises an eyebrow and says Fascinating... in only the way Mr. Spock could do that. An interesting story line of course the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying amusement of Disneyland for example) being able to have ones wishes actually come true. Really a great idea but not that well executed. And coming from Theodore Sturgeon another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in. Now here is a little trivia I learned on this very site: In 1987 James Gunn established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story. And Ill quote the rest from this site: In 1968 he {Sturgeon} wrote The Joy Machine a third script for the Star Trek TV series {Amok Time the other} that was never shot. The main reason that it wasnt used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. However the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek #80 The Original Series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996. Id sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable especially if one doesnt think too much about it. Just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe.'\")\n",

Just from looking at the box I knew the film was an Indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film.  I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day I immediately started it from the beginning again. The film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School of April of 1999 but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were. My first time through watching this film I wasnt entirely sure if what I was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at Columbine. In the back of my mind I knew what I was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake.  Is the film disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film? Probably. I think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters Calvin and Andre (Played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is that problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point. They had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped if only people around them had taken notice to their plight.  Zero Day is a phenomenal film. It gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news. It leaves you thinking about the lives involved. And it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point. A week after seeing this film I still think about it. Those of you who have not seen Zero Day please keep in mind the following: The film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending.  But if you can put all that aside Zero Day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little.'\")\n",

The Far Country is the only one out of all five Stewart-Mann westerns that is often overlooked. Stewart yet again puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five Stewart-Mann westerns. Jeff Webster (Stewart) is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. Ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. This displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick Ben Tatum played by Walter Brennan since Tatum is the one that gave it to him. Mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five Stewart-Mann westerns. He displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption. The story is that Jeff and Ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of Dawson along with gold partners Calvet and Flippen and no-good but beautiful Roman and her hired men. They are unable to leave because crooked sheriff Mr. Gannon (McIntire) and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through Skagway which is Gannons town. But eventually McIntire comes to them but not to collect Stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. What is McIntire there for? He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. People are killed. A sheriff for Dawson is considered needed and Calvet elects Stewart because he is good with a gun. Stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out. He also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed. So Flippen is elected instead. A miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of Gannons men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named Madden who carries two guns played by Wilke. Flippen attempts to arrest Madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk. A man named Yukon replaces Flippen. Stewart and Tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by Gannons men. Tatum is killed and Stewart is wounded. Stewart finally realizes that he must do something or Gannon will take over Dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like Skagway. The audience also realizes what Stewart must do. Another thing that the audience realizes is that Stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and Gannon. If Stewart leaves Gannon would take over the town. If Stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. This is where a great scene occurs. Stewart walks into his cabin. He has a sling on his arm. For a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up Stewart is in the background just inside the door. He stares at it for a few seconds. He tosses the sling away. The sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor. This is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. He comes into his new life of helping people when they need help. What ends the film is a guns-blazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright.'\")\n",

Unfortunately the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again making fools out of all of their peers. The show boasts excellent camera-work. The lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. It really is a work of art to see. Unfortunately the story is a cartoony overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence rape and lies.

Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a low down vile Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with Shane that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic. None of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. Once theyve shown these characters ruin other peoples lives for their own ends thats it.

For a more interesting look at an invisible being get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.'\")\n",

Powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30s and Arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. They are extremely fun to watch so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. Eric Blore also has some comic turns as Powells butler. Powells contract with MGM included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio but he wanted to work again with Arthur and he liked the script so he eagerly accepted the assignment.

An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as humor or even entertainment in Rabbit Test. So as a small contribution to this future effort Id like to suggest this word:  Hubiriffic (adj.) A combination of hubristic and terrific; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film Rabbit Test. Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. Trying to put together an Airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags (Note to Joan: German doctors havent been funny since Vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the Catskills - thats is bad enough. But compounding this cinematic crime is Rivers directorial style which can best be described as ugly and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags. Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the films hapless protagonist Lionel. Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.

Plot (what little there is): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen) a young billionaire with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant. Clay has been secretly engaged to his mothers PA Samantha played by Jessica Alba. On the night that these two secretly get married it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found. Go and figure the odds of that one! Once on the operating table Clay finds out the anesthesia isnt working and he can feel everything and hear everything. Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha which we are told hes doing through an annoying voice-over which never seems to stop. If you didnt burst out in laughter yet you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes.  How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon one nurse an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior which is too preposterous to be taken seriously...the operating room isnt even kept sterile...people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clays thoughts none of which are too fascinating. Ah...but heres what its all about ...the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. Believing him to be unconscious the villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen?  Well... at least theres no interference from anyone else in the hospital while an incompetent doctor whos got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery. Not even Clays overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status. The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha...but oh no...could sweet Sam be in on it....Youll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog... In the end it wouldnt even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases. If you can ignore the feeling that the director/writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness maybe theres some dumb fun to be had... Enjoy...'\")\n",
      "(401, \"'CitizenX(1995) is the developing worlds answer to Silence of the Lambs. Where `Silence terrorized our peace of mind `Citizen exhausts and saddens us instead. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals. CitizenX may also argue against(!) the death penalty far better than Kevin Spaceys The Life of David Gayle(2002). Humans are Machiavellian mammals under which lie limbic brains (lizard-logic). Why did two kids who knew better stone to death a toddler they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women yell `li-lilililililii at acts of OBSCENE terrorism? -My own term for this is `limbic domination the lizard-logic urge to dominate an `enemy. If you have the words `enemy/`vengeance in your vocabulary youre easily capable of `limbic domination. In WWII-devastated 1980s Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don river near the Black Sea) nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilos urge for `limbic domination from overpowering his layers of civilization. Chikatilo(Jeffrey DeMunn)s easy victims were paupers usually children who rode the interurban train for fun since they couldnt afford anything else. CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such `lambs. Rostovs serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go. The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere. Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world in the west vote-grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter-agency rivalries stymieing a more coordinated response to crime. In the Soviet Union of CitizenX however Viktor Burakov(Stephen Rea)s Killer Department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy. Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority--to the point of complete obscurity. In real life too Chikatilo had a lifetimes experience blending in and evading capture. His pursuer on the other hand sticks out as a strange bird given to unheralded naive outbursts. Perhaps by design Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief Burakov. Reas Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humourless and sullen at odds with everyone. So its Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture. Sutherlands Col.Fetisov Burakovs boss and at first his only supporter is an overly restrained patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His reawakening as a logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the films cornerstone idealism. Joss Ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk overseeing the investigation. Naturally he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect a Communist in 1984 a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo. Soon he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik Detective Gorbunov(John Wood) insisting that the investigation now focus on `known homosexuals. The funniest scene of this sad sad film comes during Bondarchuks & Gorbunovs institutionalized harassment: one stupid cop earnestly reports `As I suspected comrade its fornication. Ive made some drawings--cue howling laughter. 5yrs after the bodies began piling up in 1987 the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky(Max Von Sydow) who termed the UNSUB `CitizenX. He later also observed to Fetisov & Burakov that `...together you make a wonderful person. We concur. The drawn-out pace spread over a decade perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost--`openness--that wasnt. The contrast with Perestroika--`restructuring--couldntve been greater for the case. Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations police plans were about to bear fruit. In 1990 Col.Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. Staff communications publicity--suddenly all were available. In just one night of telephoning around Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the FBIs Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico where Fetisov discovered staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators. Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief now `Colonel Burakov of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movies powerhouse watershed scene. Fetisovs is the most tender apology Ive ever seen on film: `Privately I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance he almost whispers. A HBO production CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber. Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest) but Randy Edelmans soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. Chikatilos actual murders are depicted as bleak aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world. This makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place--but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us `we all cherish the futures of our children. CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply. Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. So do some soldiers. Such `limbic dominators make poor humans. WARNING-SPOILER:----------------------------------------------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the worlds most prolific known serial killer. Convicted he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet Union death sentences: one shot in the back of the head. Foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death. Conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ The best outcome is always the prevention of killings not their prosecution. Executions merely guarantee societys failure to learn from the complex reality of victims deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW/WHY they died. Nor do killers learn regret if theyre dead. Vengeance doesnt unkill victims. Baying for the killers blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once its too late. Vengeance on behalf of the grieving isnt justice for the deceased--its appeasement of the living.(10/10)'\")\n",

Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN and there have been many home video versions of it over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though the most workable edition Ive seen of it goes by the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS and its an unedited and complete European version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURYs print. It is also letterboxed. Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that hes contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair. He takes care of her and her lover while in animal form but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently the doc attempts to tame the werewolf and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged Daninsky who is under her trance at least in the original version. Ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a she-wolf!  The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschys claims) was often drunk and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy its not quite as difficult to make out whats going on though the editing remains atrocious in spots. Worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of Naschys ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO aka FRANKENSTEINS BLOODY TERROR) and mixed into this one without any sensible reason! The wolfs clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again as does his demeanor; one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from FURY next he is growling and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR.

Rather than being exploitation or demeaning these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era. Well not Bucktown. In this story Duke returns to Bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother. He quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses. Duke resists and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police. Unfortunately he does so by calling in a posse of his friends (these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with Duke on jobs in the past) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood. And literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it. Ignorance is not a justification for murder and it would have been much more entertaining to see the Cracker Police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street. While revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre it is a far cry from seeing Pam Grier track down the thugs who offed her family cuss them out give them a jujitsu ass-kickin and set their fro on fire. That has art (and a reason for existing) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back. Of course in this bizarre tale she is playing a woman completely under The Mans thumb afraid of the Crackers who run her town and oppress her people. Indeed her advice to Duke is Run man they gonna kill you! Following the sickening and gratuitous violence we are expected to believe that the towns mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of Duke and his friends congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor as opposed to say calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody. Dukes posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree. They immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their Cracker Police predecessors (to quote the mayor They are ten times worse than what we had before!). Now Duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of Bucktown from corrupt protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets. Unfortunately Duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force. I wouldnt have cared one way or the other if he had rescued Bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point. I suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way Duke has to outsmart the new Police Goons but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence Duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the Cracker Police. Duke is a pig. Finally when everyone in town but Duke Aretha and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin in the street our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they dont. Duke is merely a murderous thug and Aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice.

They had been busted learned their lesson gone straight and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen.

They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivet\\xc3\\xa9 about them that was quite appealing. We wanted to be more like them than we were sorta. My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off which was apparently too moral for this film. By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering wisecracking criminally minded redneck baiting misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were -- Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys? I wanted to punch them both in the nose. They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who havent grown up. There should be no marijuana use no gawking at buxom nubile coeds & their breasts no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood. All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies. The problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show IMHO shouldnt be seeing this movie either and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money which is exactly how I feel. What were they thinking??? And boy did they *EVER* get Daisy wrong. Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom. She is hardly in the film at all (which is the movies only saving grace) and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive. Catherine Bachs Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her but the Daisy she played was a *PERSON*. The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it. She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home. And most importantly she was a sweet caring person who couldnt help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her. By contrast Jessica Simpson appears phony contrived made up costumed posed aloof bored out of place and I dont think she even looks that great in the outfit. She doesnt look like a person but a plot device conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent. Ms. Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened. Whatever the joke was she isnt in on it and is disgracefully exploited for T&A. If thats all she wants from her career executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least because this effort was just pathetic. The bottom line is SKIP IT. For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together. That was why it worked. The only real purpose I can see in the film might be its future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay.

He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to return. The social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments.

This movie doesnt have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why. First you dont really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here its suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isnt the way to go here. I mean what is that? he looks like hes on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner its not natural Im surprised he didnt dislocate his jaw during filming.

I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are up in young gay men. This is in no way meant to bash gays (I am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others. The only part of the movie I couldnt understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include Marcel in Leos illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral.

I cant imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself included. Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire) starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since theres no tangible supernatural element here. While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) Polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats. Suspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audiences expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them) not literally with peoples nerves. In my book Rosemarys Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character.

In addition to this there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves. This show is not BSG -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making. There are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes I have seen so far. What it does have are very good stories characters and themes. It also has good performances from the actors. They can make a culture which is similar to modern-day society but alien at the same time be completely believable. Like BSG this show is about humanity - our strengths weaknesses potential and flaws. It may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties antique cars and chicken.

They walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if theyre in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist.

Hadley didnt do what she did out of a sense of justice she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family AND to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia it simply proves that a victim isnt always a good person. Some of them really do have it coming even if it was a painful horrible death. The Burning Bed is a great example of this but the difference is that the vile man in The Burning Bed got exactly what he deserved. But did Alicia have it coming? Some will say that she did but others dont agree and the law generally doesnt either. As for acting its a mixed bag. Some do a good job like Mia but others just came across as indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing. The music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy especially if you like girl/girl action. The movie isnt badly shot at all but given its glaring weaknesses the strengths are in background unfortunately. Ive heard rumors of a sequel but given the years I doubt itll happen.

What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons cats fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway this is one strange pair Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother age 79) apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where were mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense except to them. They live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever (Look that cats going to the bathroom behind my portrait!) and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edies voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as eccentric and Id have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for wacked out of their gourds but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them.

Ill just call it a natural progression. Let the apocalypse begin but meanwhile we have to listen to the same brazen slanted politicians who propose another new society well dont be fooled well all still be controlled by the wealthy by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place. Nothing will ever change. Al Gore whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle tobacco pig farming (which accounts for methane gas traces) and who knows what else his wealth is predicated on exploitation greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records. I hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party that is all meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling. This bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet hes lecturing poor people in Africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques? He travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets uses product placed computers in the documentary and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue. Hes entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister (from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things). Did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines? NO. Everything must serve the economy so why is he any different the answer is he is not. His forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous all this while hes being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes. Well Mr Gore why dont you try living like the common people then? He is a politician plain and simple he has a career invested in the power structure. My question is why doesnt he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications? He doesnt do that because it would be unwise for investments stocks and corporations. Al Gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary namely to wealthy white people in the audience who clap on cue while showing them graph charts numbers and percentages and speaking in a dreary tone no one without a Harvard (which the elites control) education can make sense out of it but he tells us everything is going to hell. No kidding but I think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet namely that it is expendable and a waste dump. He never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system. Its obvious he was spoiled sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing inconsistent dullard in Washington. Whoever made this propaganda as it is in no way different than what the Republicans have conceived had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse. That is to say someone is going to benefit and it seems the new green politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the new Utopian future with new technologies. Its the same old story Al Gore is a believer in the elitist structure he actually believes there is a democracy in the US which I find very naive. If we arent paying wages to the oil companies then well be paying them to the wind and solar companies. I find the speech at the end quite rancid along the lines of something GW Bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses Gore speaks about people uniting together to defeat communism in the 1990s what it had to do with global warming absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people. With that said he didnt understand that communism never existed in the world the systems in Europe and USSR were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism no less different than what controls the US interests. Social ecology was not even mentioned here which is really a travesty. If you want to change the world then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed exploitation and violence.'\")\n",

Just take a well respected British or Australian actor make things look pretty and youre guaranteed a formula for Oscar success. The Young Victoria is no exception getting just about everything right the cinematography striking and beautiful with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally soar in the film begins with Victorias 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). As the young Victoria herself laments shes moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of Britains most influential rulers. While this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory it is the development of Victorias relationship with Albert that makes the film slightly more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era so Im a bit attached to these figures. Despite their many flaws as rulers Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people. They left their legacy in the arts in public health and education and in Victorias conservative views and mourning culture after Alberts death. But these things are only briefly hinted at during the film. It is fairly well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages. Even if it did occur behind the scenes theirs was certainly one of the best known. Blunt and and Friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice the proper mix of restraint and desperation. Its a different love not usually shown on screen especially in this sort of film. Its encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field. But we dont get to see that love enough. While the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings it doesnt quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high. Also without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair things feel a bit in limbo superficial instead of intimate and sometimes confusing. Its not as big an issue during the film but afterward the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched despite the perfect performances by the leads most noticeably Blunt who even captures the famous monarchs expressions. For as much as it tries Victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic.'\")\n",

Something that curiously in all the previous comments no one has pointed out  but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie  the Turkish Baths sequence: a back street at night the entrance of a sleazy sauna and Scalise wrapped in a sheet getting his thighs massaged. Steve the masseur is of the young rough boxer ( Beefcake!) type  and another guy a bodyguard? finishes dressing up. Dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away. We know he has a reputation for roughing up suspects. Good cop but getting out of control easy. Why is it that he hates them so much ?  Could it be that he hates himself. This part of himself he inherited from his father ? That dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk into the gutter ? What if that dark side lurked within a closet ? Remember : whenever Dixon meets Scalise ( 3 times) the guy is lying on a bed and he only has men around him for company ( the irony of the  Girls poster pinned up on the wall near his bed !). Scalise acts funny: affected manners cranking his neck arrogantly defiant shoving his inhalator ( poppers ?) into his nostrils each time he talks to Dixon. Dixon with a vengeance is bent on pinning down Scalise who seems not to understand : I never saw a man so full of hate as you. I consider it almost humorous the way you came after me alone.  Four years jumping at me as if I was somebody special! Why?  Because Scalise is someone special indeed : he is the direct inheritor of Dixons father :  Your father liked me Your father set me up in business. He stands as Dixons criminal brother his dark side incarnate. And to top it all he prefers the company of men. Dixon knows it well : Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? Playmates ! Notice how each time they meet Dixon manhandles Scalise: he picks the address-book out of his jacket slaps his face punches him. Scalise : I warn you not to touch me!  . Dixons homophobia is obvious. Or put it different : his unexpressed homosexuality . Dixon aka Dixons kid is the son of a thief. In reaction to this he decided to become a cop a good one but there is something of the criminal in him a dark side: he is a violent copper a murderer a liar. Besides he is not married brings a dizzy blonde to his familiar eat-out place every now and then but nothing else. The waitress scoffing says that he doesnt know how to make love to a woman. Dixon has a deep feeling of guilt and hates himself for those reasons. A hood and a mobster like his old man. Blood will tell. Finally in order to achieve redemption Dixon decides to sacrifice himself : if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him he will free himself from the guilt and free the girl and her father too. The end of the movie brings us back to the opening sequence : Scalise is pushed in the gutter and Dixon deserves the right to walk the sidewalk and wins the love of the dame. He is straight at last. The unspoken theme of the movie could very well be that of a man who in order to cover his repressed feelings wants to experience a womans love ( Jean Douchet) (These notes owe a lot to the film commentary by Jean Douchet in the French DVD edited by CarlottaI'\")\n",

Despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying off the beaten path (by the local creepy Irish guy natch) they do just that and wind up with their insides on the outside courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals (the descendants of the infamous Sawney Bean clan who according to the films silly plot upped sticks from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle). If you think that porn stars plus low budget horror automatically equals tons of nudity and terrible acting then think again: Evil Breed is bristling with adult stars but in fact theres not nearly as much nudity as one might expect given the talent involved and the acting although far from Oscar worthy aint all that bad (with the exception of Ginger Lynn Allen who we know can do marvellous French but whose Irish is lousy). Evil Breed opens in superb style with the brutal slaughter of a couple of amorous campers: after some brief under-canvas sex the silicone enhanced hottie is dragged from the tent and torn in half; the guy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on a spit. Its a very gory start and bodes well for the rest of the film. Unfortunately after this promising beginning things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local Irish weirdo Gary (Simon Peacock) and worst of all some sub-Scream post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!). Then just as it looks as though the film is never going to get any better director Christian Viel decides to get serious: a guy gets a knife rammed through his head and theres a gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene featuring lovely blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT a porn star but Im sure theres a career there waiting if she wants it). After that things improve rapidly as the cannibals kick into top flesh-eating gear and the film is transformed into a veritable bloodbath: Gary has a machete rammed up his ass (about time!) and is strangled with his intestines; Ginger Lynn kick-boxes a mutant; Jenna Jameson is torn open eviscerated and has her silicone breast implant gnawed on by confused cannibal; a guy gets decapitated by cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes is seen bloody bruised and naked with a dead foetus between her legs (apparantly shes been captured and used as breeding stock). All of this is so outrageously gory that it makes sitting through the less interesting stuff worthwhile and earns Evil Breed a final rating of 7/10. NB. A very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in Christian Viel eventually abandoning the project. Re-shoots were done and the gore was heavily trimmed for a US release. The good news is that although the film doesnt flow as well as it might have and is cursed with a terrible ending the UK DVD (the version I watched) seems to have been left relatively intact as far as the splatter is concerned (only 13s were cut from the film in total).'\")\n",

The story is about an expedition to Cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army. This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But seeing as this is a 30s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind-control rather than insatiable appetites. And quite frankly the revolt is somewhat underwhelming too. The whole thing is really very dull. Aside from the lack of horror there isnt any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this couldve provided much entertainment even 70 years ago.

Released about 14 years sooner than the former film Grand Canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime. To me Crash was still a slightly better film but Grand Canyon was no slouch either. Taking place in Los Angeles an upper-class lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time. He calls for a tow truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car. Soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps Simon (Danny Glover) to take the truck away. Both men are threatened but Simon manages to get himself Mack and the car out of dire straits. It is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with Mack helping out Simon just as Simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier. You see Simons sister Deborah (Tina Lifford) is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people. Mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking Simon up with his secretarys friend Jane (Alfre Woodard). This is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above (Mary Louise Parker) as well as Macks wife (Mary McDonnel) who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son Roberto (Jeremy Sisto in his first movie role) has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon. The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes. This simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story. The director Lawrence Kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was The Big Chill has created a splendid movie here. The cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that wouldve made the film even stronger are glossed over. The story involving the secretary is one and the second involving Simons nephew is the other. These scenes shouldve been more apart of the entire story and then maybe Lawrence Kasdans views of life between the upper and lower classes wouldve been more on a superior level instead of just very good. Still Grand Canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after. There is also a small role for Steve Martin as Davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movies ideas.'\")\n",

      "(675, \"'Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a womans sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. Rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews Ive ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street. Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young womans search for information about her mothers never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance Ruth not only sits shivah (the Jews week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouses labors. Her American-born daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by moms assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannahs fiance a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that shell disown Hannah if she doesnt give up doting handsome Luis. Stay tuned. A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about moms childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. So Hannah having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruths life traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not this would have been a very short film. But Ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade) now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital. The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use Israel as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add Sarah to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabians name on its characters list with the false Israel included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps those married to Aryans were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that theyre confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them (Jew-loving whore being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde.  Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men and a handful of women are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but thats another story). Von Trotta builds up the tension and each womans story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect shes not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered. The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Todays Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lenas husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose fathers death triggers a need to discover her familys past. These things happen (although the Timess critic appears not to know that). Von Trottas hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lenas violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim copy and paste school of Teutonic nastiness. But thats understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim its a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THATS why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on. The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So a ray of light it was and von Trottas movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always will. 9/10'\")\n",

It takes place in a fictional cartoonish Washington D.C. and centers around the satirical childish representations of George W. Bush Condoleeza Rice Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney. Other politicians are also satirized in the same manner and act as minor characters. The pilot of little Bush much to this commentators expectations proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production which barely delivers on its featured promise: a satirical look at the current presidential administration. While one must admit that premise of the show does have SOME merit even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired execution that can only be described as sloppy at best and downright awful at worst has marred what little potential the show had. Lil Bush which may be technically classified as satire tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar (but not particularly original entertaining or funny) ways. The shows consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording Bush/Cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television. As such most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clich\\xc3\\xa9s some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already. Comparing the Vice President to Darth Vader for example may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the Daily Show/Colbert Report/Letterman/Conan OBrien/Leno monologue/any late-night-talk-show-ever but it is not funny here. As if that were not enough the shows plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old tiresome Bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program. In the shows defense when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke (which seems to be a rarity) it is often somewhat humorous. If the show were to expand its depth somewhat and place its characters into new situations exotic situations rather than the same old mistakes and quagmires perpetuated by the Bush administration therefore not having to rely on the same old Bush jokes over and over again the show might be considered somewhat tolerable and possibly even innovative. Ultimately it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the Lil Bush series the most damage; its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality or its painfully narrow minded ambitions. It is reasonable to expect that Lil Bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans that is if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing; so long as the program continues to lampoon the Bush administration thoroughly.

The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive. It is mostly a photo-shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. Aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters/Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building (and crushing Kate) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water.

      "(769, \"'***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Packed with memorable moments (such as the quote above immortalized by Primus) Deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood film. There are virtually no special effects whatsoever the setting is extremely realistic and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty. The city boys look like city boys and even the tough guy Louis portrayed with precision by Burt Reynolds is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. This is a perfect example of a what-if film. What if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives? There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. This communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them. While Drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film) Louis is having some difficulty buying the gas and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. When the boy turns away from Drew who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session Bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react. This is the kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. This great scene where a lot of fun was had (including the funniest redneck dancing scene until O Brother Where Art Thou?) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other. These people are apples and oranges and they live by completely different rules of life. The people that Louis Bobby Drew and Ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws and live by the rules of nature which do not include thou shalt not kill. Confused by their awkward behavior the four friends set out on the river hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin. (spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. I think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film namely the assaults and actual murders takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no gratuitous violence here its all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect. The move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. The trip down the rest of the river after the assault which takes up the majority of the film delivers some spectacularly effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb. It is surprisingly effective when we find out that Ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff and the tension in the film doesnt even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputys brother-in-law is missing. This is a very disturbing film which is a testament to its success because its pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit. The hillbillies are the human (i.e. more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2 neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that its almost like we as individuals of the audience are really a fifth member of the team. Its not often that a film is able to come across that way.'\")\n",

The second problem which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots if you will) is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman) in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here. The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience. The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The main point of her performance that didnt seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon Barbeau. To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole. Finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie. So whats my holistic grading of this piece? Id give it a solid C+ to B- depending upon how much credit youre inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit fizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performance.

All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait thats not all. Youll get a brand new truck a $6000 raise and you and your wifes struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice.

The so-called Barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but its almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really ill-conceived. The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass while the other twins loincloth barely covers his muscular butt.

Is he really that talented? Does he really have any genuine original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be Fincher Tarantino and Leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? After watching Revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? What happened to his great sense of humour? Where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? Revolver tries to be clever philosophical and succinct it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. However in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. Its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. So what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces. Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like Fight Club Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It aims high but inevitably shots blanks aplenty. Revolver deserves to be lambasted it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur.

Another problem is that the peripheral characters whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect that they fail to be relatable in any real way.  However one has to give some style points to the filmmakers who obviously grew up in the video generation and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot.

The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically this isnt my cup of tea. The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t-shirt. So in the very beginning you get to see Reves lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues. Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus theres a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined.

Also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a whole explanation as to why/how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldnt be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus.

Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days The Bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if thats the right spelling) and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap.

Heres to hoping thats not a general rule as Wes Cravens own sequel to the original The Hills have Eyes \\xc2\\x96 released somewhere during the mid-80s \\xc2\\x96 is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made. Part two didnt have an actual plot and re-used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise. Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re-experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies. There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well. The remake came out barely one year ago and heres the sequel already? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. Dont they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary menacing and disturbing? With his excellent film Alexandre Aja nearly single-handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. Also Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic High Tension but who is this new director? Ajas The Hills Have Eyes was an unexpected hit appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over-enthusiast target groups. Its a really good film and even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable its highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Ajas smashing hit. Bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism I must admit this rushed sequel really isnt as awful as anticipated. The screenplay is routine and clich\\xc3\\xa9d horror fodder introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive-looking freaks. After the events of the first film the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests which took place there in the 50s and 60s. For the horribly mutated survivors of the miners community that stayed there during the radioactive testing the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck. They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines. This basically is just another by-the-numbers slasher with dumb characters who are even after losing several of their friends already still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill. Its also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year-old son. The Hills Have Eyes II completely lacks \\xc2\\x96 as to be expected \\xc2\\x96 originality logic and plausible situations. The mutated miners arent nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one mainly because they arent organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex-hungry prototype monsters. Since you dont care for the amateur G.I. Joe heroes and definitely dont feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last years original. Most peculiarly this second film isnt nearly as violent and gory as the first! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise-twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor. There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics \\xc2\\x96 mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns \\xc2\\x96 but there sadly arent any outrageous pick-axe battles or virulent dog attacks. What a shame! Whats the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and/or gratuitous filth of the original? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental and youll have the most fun spotting all the things that dont make the slightest bit of sense! For example wallets falling out of peoples bloodied heads women without any muscle power cast as tough-ass soldiers and \\xc2\\x96 my personal favorite \\xc2\\x96 assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications.'\")\n",

Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere 66 mower at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynchs trademark motifs coming through. Lynchs focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced. The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism that it wasnt a typical Lynch film. Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isnt his own. Brundage claims with his protagonist Alvin Straight quoting lines directly from Confucious. He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature. The narrative is slow and thoughtful which gives you a real sense of the protagonists thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks which only adds to the effect which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didnt win. Regardless however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor.  So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynchs complex narratives or trademark dialogue the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!'\")\n",

Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight. Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls.

Of course when the MILF is Jennifer Welles then it is a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look as delicious undressed as Ms. Welles. Its worth the price alone to see Ms. Welles look at herself in the mirror as if shes Aphrodite. Shes no Stiflers Mom. Shes way sexier. I also digged Chris Jordans Anna. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her separated at birth twin or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism. Unlike 1990s soft-core porn 70s softie porn retained the hardcore films realism (something that 2000s soft-core has brought back on occasion instead of the 90s music and canned orgasms) and it is here in full force. Its not real but it feels real. For those who enjoyed the Quebec produced Deux Femmes En Or youll enjoy this one.

      "(986, \"'I was lucky enough to catch this film finally on Turner Classic films tonight as it is one of the films that won an Oscar (for special effects) in their yearly month of Oscar winning films.  BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of MARY POPPINS. That film too was a big success and an Oscar winner (Best Actress for Julie Andrews). Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it in a role wherein he learns about parenting. It is a fine mixture of live action and animation. It is set in a past period of British history (if not the Edwardian - Georgian world of 1912 London it is Englands coastline during the Dunkirk Summer of 1940). It even has old Reginald Owen in it here as a General in the Home Guard whereas formerly he was Admiral Boom in MARY POPPINS. Ironically it was Owens final role. The Home Guard sequences (not too many in the film) reminds one of the British series DADS ARMY dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war. The period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the Blitz in London. And (in typical Disney fashion) in the musical number Portobello Road different members of the British Army (including soldiers from India and the Caribbean (complete with metal drums yet!)) appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume. All of which surprisingly is a plus. But the biggest plus is that for Angela Lansbury her performance as Eglantine Price is finally it: her sole real musical film lead. In a noteworthy acting career Lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as Auntie Mame in the musical MAME that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did. She had been in singing parts (in GASLIGHT with her brief UP IN A BALLOON BOYS and in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY with LITTLE YELLOW BIRD and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of THE HARVEY GIRLS with the final reprise of ON THE ATCHISON TOPEKA AND THE SANTA FE). But only here does she play the female lead. So when you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play Mame Dennis Burnside. The rest of the cast is pretty good Tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure. The three children (Cindy OCallaghan Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their Edwardian predecessors in POPPINS (Weighill in particular as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing Lansbury after finding out she is a witch). The only surprising waste (possibly due to cutting of scenes) is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film. With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part. Also of note is John Ericson as the German officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British countryside and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are seeking.  As for the animation the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages. As I said it is a pretty fine sample of the Disney studios best work.'\")\n",

Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a hero character that you have no vested interest in. I dont know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all b****es a few times too. Ive enjoyed LaButes early films and a few of his plays...but its a strange fascination he has. Id give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyns performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance (bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead) it seems like all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue white and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well. This movie is so wrong-headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed. Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill. Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it. Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl. Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promising acting career in a brawl with Cage. Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu. Nicholas Cage screaming Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it? for no reason. Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (Im not kidding) running through the woods taking off the costume (but leaving the bear feet on) and then doing some karate moves to some villains.

Needless to say if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal.

Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie you didnt feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything.

It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay. It would seem that Redd Foxxs (RF) wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in Phoenix. He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles. So as RF arrives Norman wearing nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts gets out of his waterbed to answer the door. Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor Norman tries to wake his lover who steadfastly refuses to budge. It was just to the point where I wrote WHY wont he wake up? when suddenly he does and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed swirl-hairdoed Garson Normans white live-in lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream\\xc2\\x85 Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A. He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch. Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit. Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico. While he is on the phone Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him. With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation (but sounding more like were about to hear a very special track by The Emotions) he realizes that his son is gay. His first impulse is Ill kill him. Ill kill him. Then RF goes on a long walk wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon. His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man. Surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought. He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody. Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night. He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife and tells the tale of his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau. They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose. Once more mouths were agape. So it seems that wouldnt ya just know it RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see staid traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highly-effeminate entertainment of mega-queens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer! Its really JUST that simple! This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape! when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than youd think. There was so much that was just off. WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship? They dont seem to have ANY rapport and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexuality-\\xc2\\x97and sitting right down on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends. Other than that its kind of just what it seems like: a little relic of a bygone era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance we could all learn to love and understand one another! And because of the whole naivet\\xc3\\xa9 of this thing the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years. I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by extension convert them. ------ Hey check out Cinema de Merde my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in).

Its lesson is schematic right-angled and linear: See how women are objectified exploited abused then tossed on the trash heap by a male-dominated society. Bettie Page supposedly was the pin-up queen of the 1950s the ass millions of men ejaculated to. (All reviewers repeat that phrase pin-up queen of the 1950s like a choir of monkeys.)

Although she believes in Jesus she enjoys frolicking nude before a camera lens -- just the wholesome girl-next-door sex-slave American males supposedly fantasize.

I dont make feminist films in the sense that I dont make anything ideological. But I do find that women get my films better. What a cozy clique. The movie merely goes through the motions of telling the story of a human life its subject and purpose having been eulogized and interred well before the movie began. Ms. Page has a boyfriend but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship. In fact there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film.  One cant ignore its smug simplicity. In New York where Ms. Page tries her best to fit into and appease a mans world letting herself be tied up in the ropes of bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and bodices of S & M the movie is black and white. But down in Miami where she goes to get away from it all gleefully takes off her clothes and is photographed by a liberated female the movie turns into color.

It flopped everywhere. Oddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV. A home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers.

I did however love the scenery this movie takes you all over the world and that is a bonus. I also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it not too much or too little but enough that it got my attention. The actors needed to be more handsome...The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal not sexy enough. I think for most guys Sascha will be hot enough but for us ladies that are fans of action Nevsky just doesnt cut it. Overall this movie was fine I didnt love it nor did I hate it just found it to be another normal action flick.'\")\n",
